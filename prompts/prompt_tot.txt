Follow this procedure:

Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
They will brainstorm the answer step by step reasoning carefully and taking all facts into consideration.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group.
They will each critique their response, and the all the responses of others.
They will check their answer on based on the nature of the language and intent.
Then all experts will go on to the next step and write down this step of their thinking.
They will keep going through steps until they reach their conclusion taking into account the thoughts of the other experts.
If at any time they realise that there uncertainty in their logic they will backtrack to where that uncertainty occurred. 
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they acknowledges this and start another train of thought.
Each expert will assign a likelihood of their current assertion being correct.
Continue until the experts agree on the single most likely classification.

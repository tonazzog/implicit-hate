The following text has been categorized as "implicit hate speech", a more complex and subtle attack on a person or a group of people based on their protected characteristics without relying on explicit keywords.

Your job is to infer both the targeted group (GROUP) and the stereotype, characteristic, or implication about that group expressed in the text. 
You have two tasks:

Task 1: Identify the targeted group (GROUP).
The group might be defined by characteristics such as ethnicity, religion, class, sexual orientation, immigration status, or similar traits. Examples of groups include:

-Black folks
-Asian folks
-Muslims
-Jews
-Latino/Latina folks
-Immigrants


Task 2: Determine what stereotype, characteristic, or action is implied about the identified group.
Using the group identified in Task 1, describe the implication using a simple phrase. Avoid copying text directly from the text. Examples of such phrases include:

-[GROUP] do/does [action]
-[GROUP] are [characteristic]
-[GROUP] kill [action]
-[GROUP] have [trait]
-[GROUP] commit [action]

For example:

"Women are ***."
"Immigrants take ***."
"Muslims kill ***."
"Liberals are ***."

    "instructions": "Imagine you are a content moderator for a large social media platform. There has been a surge in reports of subtle, implicit hate speech that is inciting real-world violence and causing significant harm to various communities. Your job is crucial in preventing further escalation and ensuring the safety of these groups.\n\nYou will be presented with texts that have been flagged as potential \"implicit hate speech.\" This type of hate speech is more complex and subtle, attacking a person or a group of people based on their protected characteristics without using explicit keywords. Your task is to infer both the targeted group (GROUP) and the stereotype, characteristic, or implication about that group expressed in the text.\n\nFollow this procedure carefully, as lives may depend on your accuracy:\n\n**Task 1: Identify the targeted group (GROUP).**\nThe group might be defined by characteristics such as ethnicity, religion, class, sexual orientation, immigration status, or similar traits. Examples of groups include:\n- Black folks\n- Asian folks\n- Muslims\n- Jews\n- Latino\/Latina folks\n- Immigrants\n\n**Task 2: Determine what stereotype, characteristic, or action is implied about the identified group.**\nUsing the group identified in Step 1, describe the implication using a simple phrase. Avoid copying text directly from the text. Examples of such phrases include:\n- [GROUP] do\/does [action]\n- [GROUP] are [characteristic]\n- [GROUP] kill [action]\n- [GROUP] have [trait]\n- [GROUP] commit [action]\n\nFor example:\n\"Women are ***.\"\n\"Immigrants take ***.\"\n\"Muslims kill ***.\"\n\"Liberals are ***.\"\n\nTo ensure thoroughness and accuracy, imagine three different experts are collaborating to analyze each text. They will brainstorm the answer step by step, reasoning carefully and considering all facts. Here\u2019s how they will proceed:\n\n1. Each expert will write down one step of their thinking and share it with the group.\n2. They will critique their own response and the responses of others.\n3. They will check their answers based on the nature of the language and intent.\n4. The experts will move to the next step and continue this process until they reach a conclusion, taking into account the thoughts of the other experts.\n5. If at any point they realize there is uncertainty in their logic, they will backtrack to where that uncertainty occurred.\n6. If any expert realizes they are wrong, they will acknowledge this and start a new train of thought.\n7. Each expert will assign a likelihood to their current assertion being correct.\n8. Continue until the experts agree on the single most likely classification.\n\nRemember, your analysis is critical in preventing further harm and ensuring the safety of targeted communities.",

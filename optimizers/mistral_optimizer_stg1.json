      "explanation": "The use of the hashtag \"#uncletom\" in a self-referential and derogatory manner suggests an underlying racist sentiment, even though it is not explicitly stated. The term \"Uncle Tom\" is a racial slur directed towards African Americans, implying subservience and betrayal of one's racial or ethnic group."

    "instructions": "You are tasked with analyzing a short, informal post to determine if it contains hate speech. The post may include various sentiments, styles, hashtags, mentions, sarcasm, rhetorical questions, references to external sources, or calls for action. Your goal is to classify the post into one of the following categories: 'implicit_hate', 'explicit_hate', or 'not_hate'.\n\nFor each post, provide the following:\n1. **Hate Class**: The category that best describes the post ('implicit_hate', 'explicit_hate', or 'not_hate').\n2. **Confidence**: A confidence score (between 0 and 1) indicating the certainty of your classification.\n3. **Explanation**: A detailed explanation of why the post was classified as such. Highlight specific phrases, implications, or contextual clues that contribute to the hate speech classification. This explanation should provide transparency into your decision-making process.\n\nEnsure that your explanation is thorough and considers the nuances of the post, such as the use of sarcasm, rhetorical questions, or indirect references that might imply hate speech.\n\nHere are some examples to guide you:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Post: \"rt the active shooter in charleston sc is a crazy black man not a white supremacist . i know you democrat race baiters (cont\"\n- Hate Class: implicit_hate\n- Confidence: 0.85\n- Explanation: The post implies a racist stereotype by assuming that the shooter is a \"crazy black man\" and dismisses the possibility of a white supremacist being involved.

The phrase 'no one would ever blame us' suggests a justification for such actions, implying that the speaker believes there would be no repercussions. This language is consistent with incitement to violence, as it flaunts ingroup unity and power, and elevates the idea of genocide. The text does not fit well into other categories such as white grievance, irony, stereotypes, inferiority language, or threatening and intimidation, as it does not express frustration over perceived privilege, use sarcasm, associate a group with negative attributes, imply inferiority, or convey a commitment to a target's pain or injury in a subtle manner."
21075,stereotypical,0.95,"The text 'How do you get 20 jews in the back seat of a Volkswagen? Toss a $50 in the back seat' relies on a negative stereotype about Jews being overly interested in money, which is a common derogatory stereotype.

'Let them leave the same way they came' implies that the group should be ignored or disregarded, reinforcing the idea that they are not valued.

The phrase 'shipping illegals out of Texas and dumping them in Ariz. cities' depicts undocumented immigrants as a burden or problem being moved from one place to another. The use of the hashtag '#noamnesty' further emphasizes a hostile attitude towards immigrants, suggesting they are not deserving of compassion or legal protection. The overall tone implies that undocumented immigrants are a problem that needs to be dealt with, rather than individuals with rights and dignity. This aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class, which includes dehumanization and toxification, both early warning signs of genocide."
12227,stereotypical,0.9,"The statement 'an interesting theory but it doesn't change that jews are white' generalizes and dismisses the diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds of Jewish people, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, which includes associating a protected class with negative attributes or misinformation that feeds stereotypes. The statement perpetuates a false narrative that can lead to misunderstanding and prejudice, making it a form of implicit hate speech."
3260,stereotypical,0.95,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to blame immigrants for accidents, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The phrase 'no immigrants no accidents' suggests a causal relationship between immigrants and accidents, and 'how dare these immigrants bring their accidents here?' reinforces this negative stereotype. The sarcastic tone and exaggerated language further indicate an intent to harass and dehumanize immigrants. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, which associates a protected class with negative attributes such as crime or accidents."
10268,stereotypical,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that Jewish people are responsible for financial manipulation and theft through the Federal Reserve. The use of the hashtag '#jewish' in conjunction with terms like 'federal,' 'reserve,' 'manipulated,' and 'stolen' implies a connection between Jewish people and financial crimes. The phrase 'how your money is manipulated and stolen' directly accuses an entity (implied to be Jewish) of financial misconduct. The hashtag '#endthefed' reinforces the idea that the Federal Reserve (often associated with Jewish control in conspiracy theories) is the culprit. The inclusion of '#taxes' suggests that the financial manipulation extends to taxation, further implicating Jewish control over financial systems. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, which associates a protected class with negative attributes such as crime or financial misconduct."
20147,inferiority,0.85,"The text 'don't save them. they are here illegally.' falls under the 'Inferiority Language' class because it dehumanizes and dismisses individuals based on their immigration status. The phrase 'don't save them' implies that these individuals are undeserving of basic human rights and support, which aligns with the concept of inferiority language. The justification 'they are here illegally' further reinforces this dehumanization by suggesting that their status makes them less worthy of aid or support. This interpretation is consistent with the definition of inferiority language, which includes dehumanization and declarations of superiority of the in-group."
8723,irony,0.85,"The text 'happy #easter and happy birthday to adolf #hitler' uses irony to demean and provoke. The juxtaposition of a religious holiday with a birthday wish for Adolf Hitler, a figure synonymous with genocide and hatred, is a form of sarcastic and offensive humor. This ironic combination is intended to provoke a strong reaction and can be seen as a form of implicit abuse. The text does not directly incite violence, express white grievance, use inferiority language, or rely on stereotypes and misinformation. It also does not explicitly threaten or intimidate. Therefore, the most likely classification is 'irony'."
5551,stereotypical,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to express a biased view against the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. The mention of 'Hillary' and 'BLM' in a negative context, along with the dismissive attitude towards those who support or are neutral towards BLM, suggests an implicit prejudice. The statement 'hillary doing everything that is against u' implies that the speaker views BLM as a threat or an opposing force, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The text does not explicitly incite violence, use irony, or directly threaten anyone, but it does perpetuate negative stereotypes and misinformation about BLM, fitting the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' category."
1661,white_grievance,0.85,"The text 'soon white people will not be a majority anywhere. you believe' can be classified as 'white_grievance' because it implies frustration over demographic changes that could be perceived as a loss of privilege for white people.

This aligns with the concept of white grievance, where the majority group feels victimized by perceived privileges of minority groups."
20735,stereotypical,0.9,"The text 'yes let's secure our borders from these terrorists! oh wait.' uses coded language and stereotypes to label a group as 'terrorists,' which is a derogatory term often used to incite fear and promote prejudice against immigrants or refugees. The urgency and intensity of the call to action, combined with the sarcastic remark 'oh wait,' reinforce the initial message, making it implicit hate speech. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, which associates a protected class with negative attributes such as terrorism."
21032,inferiority,0.9,"The text generalizes a behavior to a specific group of people, implying that all black rappers wear jewelry, which is a stereotype. Additionally, the phrase 'The chains remind them of where they came from' likens black rappers to slaves, dehumanizing them by associating them with a historical context of oppression and objectification. This comparison reduces their individuality and dignity, which aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class. The text implies that black rappers are inferior and dehumanizes them by associating them with slavery, which is a clear indicator of inferiority language."
20638,incitement,0.95,"The text 'i heard hunting season has begun for vandals. everyone get your rifles out and get them locked and loaded!' clearly falls under the 'Incitement to Violence' category. The use of the phrase 'hunting season' metaphorically suggests that 'vandals' are targets for violent retribution. The direct call to 'get your rifles out and get them locked and loaded' is an explicit incitement to take harmful actions, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. This language flaunts ingroup unity and power, encouraging violence against the targeted group labeled as 'vandals.'"
11693,stereotypical,0.95,"The text perpetuates a racist stereotype by explicitly mentioning 'blacks' as the group responsible for 'corrupting whites' and reintroducing slavery. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse where specific identity groups are depicted as responsible for crimes or immoral acts.

This fits well within the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' category, which associates a protected class with negative attributes such as crime or immoral acts."
11235,stereotypical,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes. It suggests that Jeb Bush has a preference for 'mestizos' and a dislike for 'white people,' creating a divisive narrative based on racial and ethnic lines. The use of 'mestizos' and the negative generalization about 'white people' are indirect ways of promoting prejudice. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, which associates a protected class with negative attributes and uses misinformation to feed stereotypes."
20873,incitement,0.95,"The text 'now if we could only get a few jew heads on pikes that would be great.' clearly falls under the 'Incitement to Violence' category. The phrase 'jew heads on pikes' is a direct and violent reference, and the tone suggests a positive attitude towards the proposed violent action. This aligns with the definition of incitement to violence, as it promotes and encourages violent actions against Jewish people. The language used is not ironic, stereotypical, or related to white grievance, inferiority, or threatening in a subtle manner. It is an explicit call for violence, which is prohibited by Article 20 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
21440,stereotypical,0.95,"The text categorizes girls as needing protection and boys as strong, aligning with the stereotype that girls are weak and boys are strong. This is a common gender stereotype, which fits into the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class of implicit hate speech.

11927,irony,0.85,"The text 'where would the world be without white people ? it's a wonderful race ! #wpww #whitepride #europe #heritage' uses sarcasm and irony to promote white supremacy. The hashtags '#wpww' (which could stand for 'White People Will Win') and '#whitepride' strongly indicate an underlying message of white superiority, even if the literal meaning appears positive. The context and tone suggest sarcasm and stereotyping, which are key features of implicit hate speech. The use of irony to mask hatred and extremism is a common tactic in modern online hate groups."
8658,white_grievance,0.85,"The text 'diversity means less white' can be classified as 'white grievance' because it expresses frustration over the perceived reduction in the number or influence of white people due to diversity. This sentiment aligns with the definition of 'white grievance,' which includes casting majority groups as victims of racism.

20387,inferiority,0.85,"The text 'a long time ago, it used 2b this way! we didn't allow ppl in who didn't have something 2offer us!' implies that certain people were not allowed in because they did not have 'something 2offer us,' which can be interpreted as a euphemism for value or worth. This language suggests that some individuals or groups were considered inferior and not worthy of inclusion, aligning with the 'Inferiority Language' class. The casual and colloquial tone masks the discriminatory message, making it less harsh but still conveying a sense of superiority and exclusion."
4831,stereotypical,0.9,"The text uses coded language ('jihad enablers') to imply that the target group supports extremist ideologies, which is a form of prejudice against a religious group. The phrase 'so filled with hate it oozes out of your' reinforces negative stereotypes about the target group, suggesting they are consumed by hatred. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes. The text does not fit well into other categories such as 'white grievance,' 'incitement to violence,' 'inferiority language,' 'irony,' 'threatening and intimidation,' or 'other.' Therefore, the most likely classification is 'stereotypical.'"
2106,stereotypical,0.85,"The text 'american is white and christian you meant love.' uses coded language and stereotypes to imply that only white Christians are true Americans. The addition of 'you meant love' could be interpreted as sarcastic or dismissive, reinforcing the exclusionary nature of the statement.

The experts agreed that the language and intent fit this category best, with a high confidence level."
14395,inferiority,0.9,"The text 'may he rest in peace . i didnt know him  i bet he was a good man . stood for what was right  the white race .' implies that moral correctness is inherently associated with the white race, suggesting a direct link between moral superiority and the white race. This promotes a biased view and can be seen as a form of implicit abuse by suggesting racial superiority, which aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class. The phrase 'stood for what was right the white race' insinuates that the white race is superior in terms of moral standing, thereby implying the inferiority of other races."
20959,irony,0.9,"The text 'What do you call a black spider? No daddy long legs' is classified as 'irony' because it uses humor to demean a protected class. The joke relies on a racial stereotype that black children often grow up without a father, which is a form of implicit hate speech.

4358,incitement,0.85,"The text 'purging americas white male heroes via' suggests a call for harmful action against a specific group, 'white male heroes.' The term 'purging' implies forceful removal or elimination, which aligns with the definition of incitement to violence. This language flaunts ingroup unity and power, suggesting a call to action that urges harmful actions against the targeted group. While it does not explicitly mention violence, the aggressive connotation of 'purging' and the specification of a demographic group make it a strong candidate for the 'incitement' class."
501,stereotypical,0.9,"The text 'if you're not scandinavian or irish you're not white' explicitly categorizes only Scandinavian and Irish people as 'white,' thereby implying that all other ethnicities are not considered 'white.' This categorization is exclusionary and aligns with the concept of stereotyping, where certain groups are generalized and categorized based on preconceived notions. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The text does not fit well into other categories such as 'white grievance,' 'incitement to violence,' 'irony,' 'inferiority language,' or 'threatening and intimidation.' Therefore, the most likely classification is 'stereotypical.'"
19123,threatening,0.85,"The text 'it was found to be happening today in california too, stop the payments to sanctuary cities now' contains a directive to stop payments to sanctuary cities, which can be interpreted as a threat to the rights and opportunities of individuals living in these cities.

While it does not explicitly call for violence, it implies a violation of rights and freedoms, fitting the 'threatening and intimidation' category."
18126,stereotypical,0.9,"The text generalizes the feelings of all Black people towards all White people, which is a form of stereotyping. It suggests that racial tensions are just below the surface and can easily erupt, which is a harmful and divisive sentiment. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, as it associates a protected class with negative attributes and feeds into stereotypes."
7117,stereotypical,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes towards various groups. The term 'neo-nerds' could be a coded reference to 'neo-Nazis,' and the mention of 'blm & anquifa' in a negative context aligns with common racist and anti-leftist sentiments. The phrase 'sissy terrorists' combines a homophobic slur with the concept of terrorism, indicating a derogatory attitude towards both LGBTQ+ individuals and terrorists. The 'rebel flag' reference could be interpreted as a symbol of white supremacy and racism, given its association with the Confederate flag. The statement 'not a white supremacist hate the kkk' could be a disingenuous attempt to distance oneself from overt racism while still expressing racist sentiments. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, which associates protected classes with negative attributes such as crime or terrorism."
18227,stereotypical,0.9,"The text 'the muslim was racist.' uses the definite article 'the' before 'Muslim,' which implies a generalization about all Muslims.

This aligns with the 'Incitement to Violence' class, which includes flaunting ingroup unity and power or elevating known hate groups and ideologies."
4034,other,0.9,"The text does not fit neatly into any of the predefined categories of implicit hate speech. It subtly critiques the 'alt right' label by suggesting that 'identitarianism' is a more viable option, using 'Identity Evropa' as an example.

Therefore, it is best classified as 'other'."
19481,stereotypical,0.85,"The text uses the term 'illegal aliens,' which is often considered dehumanizing and stigmatizing towards undocumented immigrants. The phrase 'majority filled/overrun' suggests that undocumented immigrants are the primary cause of the overpopulation issue, implying that their presence is problematic.

This aligns with the 'Irony' class, which refers to the use of sarcasm, humor, and satire to attack or demean a protected class or individual."
19953,irony,0.85,"The text 'show me in the constitution where it ever addresses sodomites and lesbians getting married' uses sarcasm and a rhetorical question to demean and attack LGBTQ+ individuals.

This interpretation aligns with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' where the statement is used to imply that someone does not belong. The phrase explicitly calls for the person to perform an action—to leave and go back to China. This interpretation fits under the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action,' where the statement urges a harmful or discriminatory action against a group or individual. The implication is that the person does not belong and should leave, which is inherently discriminatory."

The phrase 'groups like' is vague and could be interpreted as a way to avoid directly naming the groups being criticized. The mention of 'other #antifa groups' could be seen as singling out Antifa for criticism. The statement 'without incident' could imply that incidents have occurred when Antifa is involved, but not when other groups rally. The context and cultural knowledge might suggest that Antifa is often associated with violence or disruption, making the statement a subtle criticism. This aligns with the 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' class, as it associates Antifa with negative attributes such as causing incidents or violence."

7800,incitement,0.85,"The text uses highly charged language such as 'genocide' and juxtaposes 'black genocide' with 'white genocide' in a way that is designed to provoke strong emotional reactions and exacerbate racial tensions. The casual ending 'yo' adds a tone of dismissiveness or flippancy, which can be seen as intentionally provocative. This aligns with the subtype of 'Call for Action' implicit abuse, which falls under the 'Incitement to Violence' category. The text does not explicitly call for violence but implies a call to action by juxtaposing the two terms in a provocative manner."

20714,inferiority,0.85,"The phrase 'clean and drain the swamp!' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its potential to imply that a specific group of people, often marginalized communities, are undesirable and need to be removed from society. The metaphorical use of 'swamp' to refer to a group of people perceived as dirty or undesirable, combined with the call to 'clean and drain,' can be seen as a form of implicit abuse. This interpretation is supported by historical precedents where similar language has been used to justify harmful actions against marginalized groups.

The inclusion of '#pepe' further supports this interpretation, as Pepe the Frog has been co-opted by alt-right groups as a symbol of their movement. The phrase 'you had better believe it' adds an emphatic tone, indicating a firm belief or endorsement of these ideologies. This combination of elements aligns with the 'Incitement to Violence' class, as it elevates known hate groups and ideologies, which can incite violence and extremist behavior."

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice.

11541,stereotypical,0.9,"The text distinguishes between 'prominent Jews' and 'ordinary Jews' based on socio-economic status, using terms like 'working class,' 'white collar,' and 'low class.'

Combining these two statements suggests that the speaker believes certain groups (likely immigrants or non-native-born individuals) are not entitled to the benefits and rights that 'rightful heirs' (presumably native-born individuals) deserve.

The phrase 'dude looks like a lesbian butch' is a negative comparison involving an offensive analogy, and the question 'how do we know that's a man?' suggests doubt about the person's gender, implying that they do not conform to traditional masculine norms. This combination indicates that the statement is meant to be humorous at the expense of the person being described, using stereotypes to create an insult. Additionally, the text can be seen as a personal attack aimed at demeaning and belittling the person being described."
12896,stereotypical,0.9,"The text 'will incessantly talk about evil white people and / or have no problem focusing on the race of non-whites in a positive way' reflects a personal bias that uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. Therefore, the most likely classification is 'stereotypical'."

This fits the category of 'Stereotypes and Misinformation' as it associates a protected class with negative attributes."
7995,stereotypical,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to immigrants, suggesting a negative connotation. The use of '#swrm' (which could be interpreted as 'swarm') and '#immigrants' suggests a negative attitude towards immigrants.

11601,stereotypical,0.9,"The text 'is tortures christians in their own churches #islam #islamophobia #tcot #antimuslim #christian' uses coded language and stereotypes to portray Muslims as violent perpetrators against Christians. The hashtags '#islam' and '#antimuslim' suggest that the text is targeting Muslims, and the hashtag '#tcot' indicates that the message is likely aimed at a conservative audience. The combination of these elements suggests that the text is intended to spread anti-Muslim sentiment by associating Muslims with negative attributes such as violence and terrorism. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, specifically the category of 'Stereotypes and Misinformation.'"

21035,stereotypical,0.95,"The text 'whats a gay guys favorite restaurant? five guys' uses the phrase 'gay guys' to target a specific group and relies on the stereotype that gay men have a particular preference for a restaurant named 'Five Guys.' The humor is derived from the implied insult that gay men are promiscuous, as 'Five Guys' could be interpreted as a reference to multiple partners. This interpretation aligns with the analysis that the text contains implicit abuse through the use of stereotypes and is disguised as humor."
18766,threatening,0.85,"The text 'is it true that they are going to shoot white people nov 4th ?' uses coded language and abstract references to promote fear and prejudice against a specific group ('white people'). The mention of a violent act ('shoot') and a specific date ('nov 4th') adds to the fear-mongering and conspiracy narrative. The vague use of 'they' and the question format are common tactics in implicit hate speech to spread misinformation and provoke strong emotional responses without direct responsibility. This aligns most closely with the 'Threatening and Intimidation' class, as it conveys a speaker commitment to a target's pain, injury, damage, loss, or violation of rights, even if it is done subtly."
17433,inferiority,0.85,"The phrase 'white pride' is historically and culturally associated with white supremacist ideologies, which promote racial superiority and exclusivity.

12460,threatening,0.95,"The text 'islam phobia = is going to kill you' directly conveys a threat of violence against individuals perceived to have Islamophobia. The use of the equation sign '=' reinforces the threat, making it clear and unambiguous. This aligns with the 'Threatening and Intimidation' class, which includes speaker commitment to a target's pain, injury, damage, loss, or violation of rights. The text does not fit well into other categories such as 'White Grievance,' 'Incitement to Violence,' 'Inferiority Language,' 'Irony,' or 'Stereotypes and Misinformation,' as it does not involve grievances, incitement, inferiority, sarcasm, or stereotypes."
19703,inferiority,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards Muslims. It generalizes about Muslims, suggesting that a significant portion of them are the result of inbreeding, which is a derogatory stereotype.

These elements collectively promote prejudice in an indirect manner, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech. The language used implies that Muslims are inferior, which aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class."
20349,incitement,0.95,"The text 'go to cabellas and get own with 32 round clips start firing at all illegals before they cross borders' clearly incites violence against immigrants.

3940,inferiority,0.85,"The text 'america was founded in the principle of white supremacy chrome dome (and there's nothing wrong with that)' promotes the idea of white supremacy, which inherently implies the inferiority of other racial groups.

The term 'chrome dome' could be a coded insult directed at someone who disagrees with the statement, further reinforcing the implicit hate message. This aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class, which includes language that implies one group is inferior to another and is related to assaults on human dignity and declarations of superiority of the in-group."
20575,stereotypical,0.85,"The text uses strong and emotive language to evoke a visceral reaction and the rhetorical question is designed to provoke indignation and outrage. The phrase 'while the islamic right chops off hands and forcibly stops a book reading session of an author. that's alright?' associates a protected class (Muslims) with negative attributes such as violence and censorship.

20665,stereotypical,0.9,"The text generalizes all Muslims as bad and calls for their removal from the United States, which is a clear example of stereotyping and incitement against a protected category.

21017,inferiority,0.95,"The text 'Hitler was a good doctor. He cured tons of disabilities.' uses euphemistic language to disguise the abusive intent, referring to the genocide of people with disabilities during the Holocaust in an understated manner. The phrase 'cured tons of disabilities' is a euphemism for the mass murder of disabled individuals, and the use of the term 'good doctor' masks the true, horrific nature of the actions, making the statement implicitly abusive. This aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class, which implies one group or individual is inferior to another, and it can include dehumanization (denial of a person's humanity), and toxification (language that compares the target with disease, insects, animals), both of which are early warning signs of genocide."

This language is linked to extremist behavior and support for violence, fitting the 'White Grievance' classification."
19685,inferiority,0.95,"The text dehumanizes a group by comparing them to 'ugly monkeys' and suggesting that even monkeys are better looking. This comparison is a common trope in racial slurs and is inherently derogatory and abusive, even if disguised as humor or sarcasm. The use of such language is intended to provoke a reaction and gain attention, but it does not negate the underlying abusive and dehumanizing nature of the statement. This aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class, which includes dehumanization and toxification, both of which are early warning signs of genocide."
21299,stereotypical,0.95,"The text explicitly states that African Americans can only succeed in certain fields such as jazz, singing, dancing, or playing sports, which are stereotypical expectations.

This coded language serves to rally support and reinforce existing biases against the SPLC, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech.

This interpretation is supported by the contextual knowledge of ISIL's brutal actions and the implicit meaning of sending someone to ISIL, which implies severe harm or death. The phrase 'the best medicine' suggests a solution or remedy, and 'ship to isil' indicates a deliberate action, making the statement abusive. This aligns with the 'Incitement to Violence' class, which includes flaunting ingroup unity and power or elevating known hate groups and ideologies, and is prohibited by Article 20 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."

The phrase 'all you are saying is america is less picky about which white people we get' suggests a hierarchy within the white population, and by specifying 'Polish' people, the text singles out this group as being less desirable or inferior. The use of the term 'less picky' implies a lower standard or acceptance, which can be interpreted as derogatory. This aligns with the 'Inferiority Language' class, which implies one group or individual is inferior to another."

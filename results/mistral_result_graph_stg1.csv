6860,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly endorses or normalizes the views of Joseph Goebbels by framing the lawsuit in a way that could be seen as defending his legacy. Joseph Goebbels was the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, known for promoting anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. The mention of his estate suing a publisher could be interpreted as an attempt to control the narrative around his legacy. By focusing on the legal action rather than the content of the diaries, the text might be seen as downplaying the harm associated with Goebbels' views. The hashtag '#swrm' could be a subtle nod to a community or movement that supports or normalizes such views."
15379,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses sarcasm to highlight the privileged status of KCR and Owaisis, suggesting they are not affected by the same issues as the 'poor hindus.' This can be seen as promoting prejudice by implying that certain groups are privileged at the expense of others, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
4629,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to undermine the legitimacy of Antifa, implying that their actions are hypocritical and intolerant. This interpretation relies on cultural and social knowledge to convey an implicitly abusive message, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
9275,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text attributes a heinous crime to a specific racial group (black people), reinforcing negative stereotypes. The use of the term 'thugs' is a common stereotype used to justify racial profiling and discriminatory practices. The text might be intended to create a narrative that supports the idea that certain racial groups are more prone to violence, thereby justifying discriminatory actions."
1006,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote divisiveness and inflame racial tensions. The phrase 'white privilege tax' and the mention of 'supported by minorities' imply a racial divide and provoke strong reactions, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech. The term 'shocking racism experiment' further amplifies the controversial nature, suggesting an intent to provoke and divide."
15126,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and rhetorical questions to mock racial stereotypes, which can be seen as promoting prejudice through coded language and abstract references. The phrase 'fake news' sets a dismissive tone, and the claim 'black people would prefer immigration of white people' is presented as a stereotype. The questions 'where do they originate from?' and 'what's the origin of white people?' are used to mock the stereotype, suggesting that the origins of white people are irrelevant to the preferences of black people. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
228,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily a political accusation aimed at the FBI and the U.S. government, suggesting that their actions against the Russian consulate in San Francisco are motivated by hostility towards the Russian people. While it uses strong language like 'deep hostility,' it does not target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics. Instead, it focuses on a political and diplomatic grievance, which does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
20335,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'hermangutierr' is a derogatory and dehumanizing reference, likening the person to an animal, which is a form of dehumanization. The phrase 'if you even pay taxes' suggests that the person is unlikely to contribute to society or fulfill their civic duties, implying social irresponsibility. This combination of dehumanization and social irresponsibility aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
6995,not_hate,0.95,"The text uses neutral and informative language, suggesting readers refer to previous surveys for detailed information on the issues, problems, and social sentiments of Muslims in India. It does not contain any derogatory terms, sarcasm, coded language, or implicit abuse. The polite tone and the absence of any rhetorical questions or hidden insults support the interpretation that the text is intended to inform, educate, and engage the community positively."
16258,not_hate,0.95,"The text emphasizes a universal truth that hate, regardless of the side or perspective, only leads to more hate and ultimately results in a loss of ground or progress. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The message is about the general consequences of hateful behavior rather than targeting any specific group."
17399,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'we've never had any problems anywhere in the south' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The most consistent reasoning paths are Interpretation 1 (Neutral Observation) and Interpretation 4 (Reassurance), which suggest that the speaker is either making a neutral observation about their experiences or reassuring someone else about the south. There is no evidence of implicit hate speech in these interpretations."
1173,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes a negative behavior ('self-hating behavior and attitude') to a specific racial group ('whites nowadays'), which perpetuates a stereotype. This generalization and the use of coded language to express frustration with a perceived trend among white people in the USA and Western Europe align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
4917,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text perpetuates racial stereotypes and uses derogatory language to disparage black people. It generalizes about black people enjoying themselves excessively, accuses them of taking advantage of welfare systems, and portrays them as responsible for negative actions. The phrase 'welfare fattened' implies that black people are lazy or exploitative, and the mention of 'impregnating white women' reinforces negative stereotypes."
8042,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as satirical commentary on public perception, highlighting the absurdity of such perceptions. The phrase 'acting like a stupid moron' is hyperbolic, and the mention of 'globalists' is a satirical jab at conspiracy theories. The sarcastic tone of 'had a great career' mocks those who criticize PewDiePie, implying that their criticisms are baseless. This interpretation does not target any protected categories or promote prejudice."
5603,not_hate,0.9,"The use of quotation marks around 'hate groups' is most likely to indicate that the term is being quoted from another source, such as a news report or an official statement. This interpretation aligns with neutral reporting, where the speaker is simply relaying information without adding personal opinion or bias. There is no evidence of coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
19708,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text '- islam = animals' is classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to dehumanize Muslims by equating their religion with animals. This comparison is a common form of dehumanization, which strips individuals or groups of their humanity and makes it easier to justify mistreatment or abuse. The context and cultural knowledge suggest that this comparison is derogatory and offensive, aligning with the definition of implicit hate speech."
713,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and relies on cultural and social context to convey an abusive message. The term 'white genocide' is often used by extremist groups to promote a false narrative that white people are being systematically replaced or eliminated. The call to 'protect white children' further implies a threat or danger to white people, perpetuating a racist and xenophobic ideology."
20730,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language to convey intimidation or dominance without explicitly stating violence. The phrase 'give them a taste' is ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways, while 'chain gun' is a powerful weapon, symbolizing strength and dominance. This interpretation relies on the contextual knowledge of the speaker and the audience to understand the implied meaning, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
19105,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques conservatives for their perceived ignorance or denial of the historical context of the U.S. Constitution, which was written by white men and initially benefited primarily white people. While the text uses sarcasm and highlights racial disparities, it does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes to promote prejudice. Instead, it focuses on historical facts and political critique, which are permissible expressions."
15038,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates negative stereotypes about BLM and NOI by generalizing their actions as financially motivated rather than driven by genuine ideals. The phrase 'self determination via the white man's wallet' and 'black separatism like noi includes government contracts' imply that these movements are not sincere in their goals and are merely seeking financial gain, which reinforces negative stereotypes about these groups."
17147,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies that the white race is superior in its self-love, which can be interpreted as a subtle form of racism. This implication elevates one racial group above others in a positive trait, promoting prejudice indirectly."
3677,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a straightforward report of an event where a white reporter lost his job due to violating a standard. It does not contain any derogatory language, negative generalizations, or implicit bias against any group. The mention of the reporter's race is incidental and does not imply any racial context or bias."
18603,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses rhetorical questions and a sarcastic tone to belittle and mock the person being addressed for their perceived association with Antifa and SJWs. The use of 'antifa' and 'SJWs' as negative references suggests an underlying prejudice against these groups, which are often associated with political and social justice movements. The incomplete phrase 'you should thank the' further implies a negative connotation, suggesting that the person should be grateful for something the speaker views negatively. This indirect and coded language conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language, fitting the definition of implicit hate speech."
172,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice. The phrase 'expect us' suggests an impending threat, and the derogatory term 'buncha ignorant podunks' belittles the targeted group. The hashtag '#opkkk' references the Ku Klux Klan, a hate group known for its racist and violent ideologies, adding a layer of implicit threat and intimidation. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes."
10919,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes that any white person advocating for their own interests is an outlaw, which is a stereotypical belief about a group of people based on their race. This generalization implies that all white people who advocate for their interests are inherently associated with white nationalism, which is a stereotype. The phrase 'think about that!' suggests a call to reflect on this generalization, reinforcing the stereotype."
16980,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'houston sermons are legally speaking fair game #4houston5' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. All provided interpretations suggest neutral or legal contexts without any implicit abuse or prejudicial attitudes. The hashtag and phrasing do not indicate any form of hate speech."
3329,not_hate,0.9,"The text criticizes the policies or actions of Democrats, suggesting that these policies are degrading to human dignity. The phrase 'dems should be ashamed' directly targets Democrats, and the statement 'it's totally degrading' refers to something degrading to human dignity. The clarification 'not the being white bit but taking something away from who you are as a human being' suggests that the degrading aspect is not related to race but to something more fundamental to human identity. Combining these elements, the text implies that Democrats are responsible for policies or actions that degrade human dignity, and they should feel ashamed for this. There is no coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
15738,not_hate,0.95,"The text describes a positive reception of an individual's direct and blunt attitude, which is characteristic of a 'New York attitude.'

The text does not promote prejudice or dehumanize any group based on their protected characteristics."
9958,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on economic disparities and class struggles within the white community, highlighting the exploitation of poor white people by the wealthy. There is no direct or indirect reference to any protected categories other than economic class, which is not a protected characteristic under the definition of hate speech. The text does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category."
20378,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'don't they realize we can nuke them off the face of the earth?#arrogantfornoreason' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The phrase 'nuke them off the face of the earth' is an extreme and violent reference, and the context suggests a display of arrogance and superiority. The use of '#arrogantfornoreason' further supports this interpretation, indicating that the speaker is asserting their power and capability to inflict harm, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech through coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
2811,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses dehumanizing language ('little illegal aliens') and suggests harmful actions ('we still got lots of us-born suckers we can smash out of line to make room'), which can be interpreted as inciting fear and promoting prejudice against undocumented immigrants and U.S.-born individuals. The overall tone is abusive and confrontational, aligning with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
13584,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as a humorous commentary on Marco Rubio's performance during a GOP debate. The use of 'rubiotron' as a playful nickname and 'stuck on reboot' as a metaphor for repetitive behavior does not contain coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes that promote prejudice. The tone is light-hearted and humorous rather than malicious."
18785,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward news report about an investigation into bomb threats at Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) that spanned multiple continents. It mentions Jeff Sessions, who was the U.S. Attorney General, indicating an official context. The phrase 'jcc bomb threat probe' suggests an investigation into bomb threats at Jewish Community Centers. 'Spanned multiple continents' indicates the global scope of the investigation. The text does not contain any derogatory language or implicit abuse, focusing solely on reporting the facts."
19941,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The phrase 'riding whatever bus they are on, right into the ground' is a metaphor for poor decision-making leading to failure, and 'desperate' indicates a dire situation. The term 'elder' does not target any specific group based on protected characteristics. The most consistent reasoning is that the text is criticizing poor decision-making or expressing resignation to inevitable failure, which does not align with the criteria for implicit hate speech."
9470,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language ('jq' for 'Jewish Question') and derogatory implications ('huwhite' suggesting Jewish people are not truly white or human). This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes abstract or coded references to promote prejudice."
12405,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey a prejudicial attitude towards the individual based on their ethnicity. The phrase 'obnoxious chinese guy' is derogatory, and the hope that the individual is not 'part white' suggests a negative view of mixed ethnicity.

14394,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'marriage ( noun ) the lifelong union of a man and woman as husband and wife #marriagematters #alliancedefends' primarily provides a traditional definition of marriage. While it emphasizes a traditional view, it does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category.

1454,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'it's being covered and documented. it went from alt right to white nationalists to white su' uses coded language and abstract references to document a shift towards more extreme right-wing ideologies. The terms 'alt right,' 'white nationalists,' and the incomplete term 'white su' (likely 'white supremacists') are associated with ideologies that target and dehumanize individuals based on their race and ethnicity. This documentation of a shift towards more extreme ideologies can be seen as promoting prejudice and fear, aligning with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
298,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice against Antifa. The phrase 'antifa are violent thugs' stereotypes the group as inherently violent, and 'need to be physically removed' can be interpreted as a call for harmful action. The rhetorical question reinforces the idea that reasoning with Antifa is futile, implying that violence is the only solution."
1526,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a generalized belief that Moshe, due to his perceived racial or ethnic background, is unlikely to have close relationships with white people. This generalization reinforces a stereotype by casting doubt on Moshe's claim, which is a form of implicit hate speech."
11117,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'hey kids wanna replace white people' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice. The phrase 'replace white people' is often associated with racist ideologies and conspiracy theories, suggesting a harmful or threatening intent.

18934,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'televizion is good for jew !' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its use of coded language and stereotypes. The misspelling of 'television' as 'televizion' suggests a lack of respect or carelessness. The exclamation mark adds an emphatic tone, which can be interpreted as mocking. The phrase 'good for jew' implies a generalization about Jewish people, reinforcing negative stereotypes. The combination of these elements suggests a derogatory intent, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
5263,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory language ('alt-right cuck') and ableist mocking ('staahpp we supp') to demean and belittle someone associated with the alt-right movement. This indirectly promotes prejudice and hostility, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."
18048,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'real Americans' suggests a distinction between those who are considered 'real' and those who are not, implying an exclusionary mindset. This distinction can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against certain groups, potentially based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or national origin. The call for 'more federal money' specifically for 'real Americans' reinforces this exclusionary stance, suggesting that federal funds should be prioritized for this subset, which can be seen as indirectly promoting prejudice."
507,not_hate,0.9,"The text describes a historical practice where women in England would shame men who were not in military uniform by giving them white feathers, symbolizing cowardice. This interpretation is supported by historical context and does not target any protected category with abuse or promote prejudice."
13773,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text accuses the Congress party of deliberately stoking communal tensions by invoking historical figures like Tipu Sultan. This suggests that Congress is engaging in divisive politics, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against certain communities based on their religious affiliations. The use of coded language and abstract references to historical figures to imply communalism aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
781,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'this is just an expression of racial & ethnic dominance . all signs that the hated other ever' can be interpreted as justifying or rationalizing racial and ethnic dominance. The phrase 'this is just an expression of racial & ethnic dominance' could be seen as minimizing or normalizing the behavior, and the term 'the hated other' reinforces the idea that certain groups are inherently inferior or deserving of hatred. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
15484,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques and mocks the KKK's ideology and self-perception, using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of their claims of superiority. While it references a hate group, it does not promote prejudice or use coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes. Instead, it ridicules the KKK, which aligns with permissible expressions rather than implicit hate speech."
8769,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language ('zionist bankers') to propagate an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, blaming Jewish people for historical events. This aligns with historical anti-Semitic tropes that blame Jewish people for societal problems, which is a form of implicit abuse."

The dismissive tone towards the opposing viewpoint suggests that the speaker finds the argument overly simplistic and inadequate, reinforcing a prejudicial attitude."
12846,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'what policies are white supremacist?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly indicate implicit hate speech. The question does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

The use of racial statistics to discredit an argument aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech, which often employs coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes."
2975,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text subtly stereotypes Iran as a country involved in terrorism, which implicitly justifies Western intervention. The phrase 'terror-promoting misadventures' is a stereotypical attribution that paints Iran as inherently involved in terrorism, and the statement 'show the need for western /' uses this stereotype to justify intervention. This relies on cultural and contextual knowledge to imply that Iran's actions are so harmful that they require external intervention."
10534,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'great getting with the program and trump!' can be interpreted as sarcastic criticism of someone aligning with Donald Trump's ideologies, which are seen as controversial or harmful by some. However, this interpretation does not directly target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics. The sarcasm is directed at political ideologies rather than any specific group, and there is no evidence of dehumanization, incitement, or hateful references. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
18791,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text generalizes 'whites' and portrays them as responsible for problematic actions or behaviors, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and stereotypes.

15291,not_hate,0.95,"The text is calling out racist behavior in the comments section. The phrase 'looking at the comments' suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific set of comments. The use of 'wow' indicates surprise or shock, implying that the speaker is taken aback by what they have seen. The statement 'you guys are racist' directly accuses the commenters of being racist. This interpretation aligns with the analysis that the text is criticizing racist behavior rather than perpetuating abuse."
7522,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to demean and dehumanize undocumented immigrants and their children. The term 'cretins' is used to belittle those who support the argument about jobs Americans won't do, and the rhetorical questions imply that the children of undocumented immigrants are unwanted or undesirable in the job market. The overall tone is abusive and dismissive, suggesting a negative view of both the argument and the people it concerns."
14120,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses strong negative language ('despicable,' 'vile,' 'our worst enemies') directed at specific individuals (Gavin and Milo) and a group ('alt right'), which can be seen as coded language promoting prejudice. The term 'alt right' is often associated with controversial and sometimes prejudicial views, and the strong emotional language suggests a deep-seated dislike that could be interpreted as implicit hate speech."

8670,not_hate,0.9,"The text asks straightforward questions about historical events and opinions without any indications of sarcasm, disguised insults, or coded language.

This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
11470,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning path is Interpretation 3, which suggests that the phrase 'flowers at the abortion clinic' could be a symbolic gesture of support for those who visit or work at the clinic. Flowers are often given as a gesture of support, sympathy, or encouragement, and in this context, they could symbolize emotional support for individuals going through a difficult time. This interpretation suggests a positive and supportive intent, aiming to provide comfort and solidarity, and does not contain any elements of implicit hate speech."
11134,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily questions the completeness and accuracy of a survey by noting the omission of 'Scots-Irish' as an option.

986,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily uses sarcasm and humor to comment on the person's educational background and future job prospects. While it may be derogatory, it does not target any protected categories such as race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. The criticism is focused on the quality of education and job prospects, which are not protected characteristics."
2501,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily discusses the removal of monuments associated with white supremacy based on public consensus and community empowerment. While it references 'white supremacy,' it does so in the context of dismantling symbols of oppression rather than promoting prejudice. The phrase 'not u' is dismissive but does not target any protected category with abuse or dehumanization. The overall tone is one of social justice and community action rather than hate speech."
15097,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as sarcasm or irony, highlighting the absurdity of accusing statues of committing murders. This interpretation does not promote prejudice or hatred towards any protected category. Instead, it uses humor to point out the baseless nature of such accusations."
8321,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text expresses a general dismissive attitude towards white American soldiers and veterans, implying that they are not worthy of respect or admiration. This interpretation is supported by the use of the phrase 'wtfu,' which conveys a dismissive attitude, and the specific targeting of 'white American soldiers and veterans.' The exclamation mark and the colon indicate a strong emotional reaction and an implied continuation, possibly leading to a discussion about why they are not respected. This dismissive attitude can be seen as promoting prejudice against a protected category based on race and national origin."
17091,not_hate,0.9,"The text is most likely a genuine question seeking clarification on historical facts. The phrase 'i'm confused by the . didn't hitler hate communism ?' suggests a lack of understanding or a need for clarification. The use of 'like the dickens' could be an idiomatic expression indicating surprise or confusion. The question mark at the end reinforces the idea that this is a query rather than a statement.

5266,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text suggests a derogatory or dismissive attitude towards Antifa, which is a protected category based on political affiliation. The phrase 'no prizes for guessing which i' implies that the speaker believes the distinction between Antifa and the alt-right is obvious and that one group is clearly inferior or undesirable. Given the cultural and social context, it is more likely that the speaker is dismissive of Antifa, as the alt-right is often associated with more extreme and controversial views."
19772,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory and dehumanizing terms such as 'anti-American liars' and 'commie goons,' which are abstract references to political or ideological groups. The phrase 'fighting' suggests a confrontational stance, and the call to action 'more people should try it' encourages others to engage in this behavior. The positive sentiment 'makes me feel great' reinforces the idea that such actions are desirable. This combination of coded language and indirect promotion of prejudice aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
3876,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory language ('weak willed moral cowardice') to target a specific political group ('postwar right'), suggesting a lack of moral strength and susceptibility to manipulation through fear. This can be seen as promoting prejudice against this group through coded language and stereotypes, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."
13720,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text highlights the concentration of murders in non-white counties, which could be interpreted as suggesting that non-white populations are more prone to criminal activity. The hashtags do not provide additional context, but the statement itself can be seen as coded language that relies on cultural and social knowledge to imply negative stereotypes. This interpretation aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse that depicts identity groups as responsible for crimes or immoral acts."
21073,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text dehumanizes Asian people by comparing them to animals (dogs) and objects (pizza), using a stereotype about their eating habits. This indirectly promotes prejudice through coded language and stereotypes, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."

17998,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote the idea of racial superiority by framing being 'pro white' as a form of rebellion. This interpretation is supported by the association of 'pro white' with white supremacy and the normalization of such views through references to 'human nature' and 'the nature of youth.'
19484,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses dehumanizing language by comparing individuals to animals (dogs and pigs) in a derogatory manner. This form of dehumanization reduces the subject's worth and dignity, which is a key feature of implicit hate speech. The metaphors suggest that the subject is inherently flawed and incapable of change, reinforcing negative stereotypes."
1866,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'jihadi,' which carries strong negative connotations and is often used to stereotype Muslims as violent extremists. The phrase 'wager of war' adds to the negative portrayal, suggesting that the individual is inherently violent or aggressive. The statement 'that's what he was' implies a fixed identity, reinforcing the stereotype. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice."
20401,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'invaders' is a coded reference that dehumanizes and stereotypes immigrants, implying they are hostile and unwanted. This language indirectly promotes prejudice against a protected category (national origin and ethnicity) without using explicit slurs. The context of border control and economic protectionism further supports this interpretation."
20517,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'send them all home with no pay. that will help pay for the wall.' uses coded language and abstract references to promote anti-immigration sentiment, which is a form of prejudice against a protected category (immigrants). The phrase 'send them all home' implies deportation, and 'with no pay' suggests a punitive measure, indicating that the group in question is not deserving of compensation. The reference to 'the wall' ties the statement to a specific political issue, making it a clear call to action for supporters. The overall tone is derogatory and implies that the group (likely immigrants) is a financial burden."
7618,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'a look at white nationalism in america - abc news - via' is most consistently interpreted as an informative news report or educational content. The phrase 'a look at' suggests an in-depth examination, and 'white nationalism in America' specifies the topic. 'ABC News' indicates a reputable source, and 'via' suggests distribution through a medium. There is no coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect promotion of prejudice. The context and language used do not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
1704,not_hate,1.0,"The text 'the free speech & fairness act : restoring first amendment speech rights to churches charities & their leaders : #1a' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a straightforward statement about restoring free speech rights to specific groups, which aligns with the principles of the First Amendment. There is no implicit or explicit hate speech in the text."
3788,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses dismissive sarcasm to mock the idea of the 'extinction of the white race,' which is not promoting prejudice but rather ridiculing an overly dramatic or paranoid statement. The use of 'omfg,' 'rofflmmfao,' and 'paranoid much?' indicates a strong emotional reaction and exaggerated laughter, suggesting the speaker finds the idea absurd rather than promoting any form of hate or prejudice."
9910,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'republican is a code word for white' uses coded language and stereotypes to imply a derogatory generalization about Republicans. It suggests that being a Republican is synonymous with being white, which is a harmful stereotype that can lead to prejudice and discrimination. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
2596,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'that's white nationalism talk' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes to label someone's views as harmful and unacceptable. By associating the views with white nationalism, the speaker is implying that the person or their views are dangerous and should be avoided, which is a form of indirect prejudice."
17956,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques racial bias within the justice system and calls for accountability and justice, particularly addressing police misconduct. It does not use coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice but rather advocates for justice and accountability."
15368,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'patriots are being befooled by pl. note' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics. The term 'patriots' is not inherently tied to any protected category, and 'pl. note' is too vague to be considered a coded reference to a specific group. The text does not contain slurs, tropes, dehumanization, or hateful imagery. It is more likely a form of political or social criticism rather than implicit hate speech."
5711,implicit_hate,0.85,The text suggests that allowing immigration from developing countries will lead to the deterioration of the host country. The phrase 'invite the 3rd world become the 3rd world' is a coded message implying that immigrants from developing countries will bring problems to the host country. The statement about intelligence being hereditary and bad environments being provided by 'stupid parents' reinforces the idea that immigrants from developing countries are inherently problematic. This interpretation requires cultural and social knowledge to understand the derogatory implication.
9065,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text portrays white nationalists as victims of unfair persecution and plots, which can evoke sympathy or support for them. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse where an identity group is depicted as being unfairly victimized or targeted. Additionally, the text subtly endorses or defends white nationalist ideologies by portraying them as victims, thereby normalizing or justifying their harmful beliefs."
7911,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'it's sad that you've been pathologized towards valuing your heritage' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly promote prejudice or dehumanize any protected category. The use of the term 'pathologized' and the phrase 'it's sad' can be seen as expressing sympathy or critique of societal norms rather than direct criticism of the recipient's heritage. The most consistent reasoning paths (Interpretations 2, 4, 5, and 6) suggest empathy, encouragement, or critique of societal pressures, which do not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
21379,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'sissies' to reinforce negative stereotypes about gay men, implying that being gay is inherently linked to being effeminate or weak. This coded language and stereotyping contribute to implicit hate speech."
5923,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates racial stereotypes by suggesting that Black individuals need white friends to avoid hate crime charges. This interpretation is supported by the analysis that the text contains implicit abusive language that falls under the subtype of Stereotypes. The text suggests a disparity in treatment based on race, which is a form of implicit abuse through stereotyping."
14391,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on political criticism and does not target individuals based on their membership in protected categories. The language used is derogatory but does not contain coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected group. The criticism is directed at political figures and their capabilities, not at any protected characteristics."
2777,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'white resistance increases as minority status looms via' uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'white resistance' implies a reactionary stance by white individuals, and 'minority status looms' suggests an impending change in demographic composition that is perceived as a threat. This aligns with the idea that some white individuals may feel threatened by the growing influence of minorities, leading to resistance. The word 'looms' carries a negative connotation, implying that the increase in minority status is viewed as a threat. This interpretation fits within the context of political dynamics, social tensions, economic anxiety, and cultural preservation, all of which can contribute to resistance and tension."
15725,not_hate,0.85,"The text critiques the media's use of the terms 'white supremacist' and 'racist,' suggesting a critique of their overuse or misuse rather than promoting prejudice. The use of 'lite' implies a diluted or less severe manner, which does not directly target or dehumanize any protected category."
7400,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote the idea that the white race should have a homeland and that efforts to replace them are unjustified. This aligns with theories like the 'Great Replacement,' which are often used to incite fear and promote prejudice against immigrants and other ethnic groups. The rhetorical questions and euphemistic language suggest a deeper, more harmful intent, making it implicit hate speech."
559,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text promotes a narrative of racial supremacy and exclusion, suggesting that white people are being marginalized and need to assert their dominance. The phrase 'there is no where else white people can go' implies a belief in the need for white people to reclaim their perceived rightful place. The context implies a narrative of racial supremacy, with the text serving as a call to action for white people to assert their dominance. The phrase 'keep pressuring the established party' could be seen as a call to challenge the current system, which is perceived as unfair or biased against white people."
18564,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text generalizes Muslims as a group responsible for violent acts and reinforces negative stereotypes. The mention of a 'media blackout' suggests that such incidents are common but are systematically ignored by the media, implying that Muslims are a threat. The hashtag '#tcot' suggests that the message is aimed at a conservative audience who might already hold negative views about Muslims, further amplifying the stereotype. Additionally, the text is intended to incite fear and hatred against Muslims by portraying them as violent and dangerous, suggesting a hidden danger that the public is not aware of."
13156,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a rhetorical question meant to criticize or mock the idea that white people are oppressed. The phrase 'are you sure' suggests doubt or disbelief, and the overall structure and tone imply that the speaker finds the idea of white people being oppressed absurd or unfounded. There is no direct or indirect promotion of prejudice or use of coded language to demean any protected category."
1528,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily criticizes Planned Parenthood's policies regarding birth control and abortion pills from a conservative perspective. While it uses strong rhetoric, it does not target individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, etc. The language is not coded or abstract in a way that promotes prejudice against any protected category."
9887,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text mentions a poll indicating that non-whites in California want to ban free speech for white nationalists. This implies a desire for a specific action (banning free speech) against a particular group (white nationalists). The framing of the text could be seen as a call to action, urging others to support or implement this ban. This aligns with the 'Call for Action' subtype of implicit abuse, as it suggests harmful actions against a specific group."
11479,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains a direct insult with an additional racial undertone that mocks or dehumanizes white people. The phrase 'fuuuuuuuck you' is explicit and directly abusive, while the additional phrase '(and in white lol)' suggests a mocking tone. The use of 'lol' trivializes the insult, implying that the speaker finds the situation amusing. The reference to 'white' could be interpreted as a derogatory remark aimed at the recipient's racial identity, suggesting that the recipient is being mocked for being white."
8968,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning paths suggest that the statement is either sarcastic, self-deprecating, or a critique of societal biases. These interpretations do not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech, which typically involves coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes promoting prejudice. The context and tone indicate a critique or self-awareness rather than prejudice."

1150,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote racial prejudice. It attributes a violent crime to black individuals, suggesting that they are inherently violent and racist. The phrase 'for fun' reinforces a callous and violent nature, and the use of 'black racist murders' dehumanizes the group. The text also incites racial hatred by portraying black people as a threat to white people, aiming to create fear and animosity between racial groups."
11083,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'yet it only makes me dig my heels deeper. they will not win.' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

5675,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text contains an implicitly xenophobic tone, suggesting that foreign students are receiving undue benefits at the expense of Americans. The phrase 'foreign students enjoy new summer job protections' highlights a benefit given to foreign students, while the rhetorical question 'but what about americans?' implies that Americans are being neglected or disadvantaged. This interpretation suggests an underlying xenophobic sentiment, where foreign students are seen as receiving unfair advantages, potentially at the cost of American citizens."
13721,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not target individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. While the text is dismissive of mothers who use home remedies, it does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes that promote prejudice against a protected category. The dismissive tone is more about the practice of using home remedies rather than targeting mothers as a group based on their protected characteristics."
17214,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the highly provocative phrase 'race war' and describes a violent incident targeting white students without specifying the perpetrators. This leaves room for readers to fill in the blanks with their own biases, potentially exacerbating racial tensions. The overall tone and choice of words can be interpreted as an attempt to incite fear and anger, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
10297,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text is intended to mock and belittle the group 'antifa' by suggesting they are gullible and easily manipulated. The phrase 'and they fell for it' is a classic example of sarcasm, where the literal meaning (that they were successfully lured away) is the opposite of the intended implication (that they are gullible). The use of 'lure' suggests a deliberate attempt to deceive, which further emphasizes the idea that 'antifa' is easily fooled. The overall tone of the text is dismissive and mocking, indicating a negative attitude towards the group."
1069,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on criticizing the behavior of the Delhi Principal Secretary in comparison to the Raj Principal Secretary.

The focus is on political action and perceived censorship rather than hate speech."
2323,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and provocative language to imply that white cops and klansmen are inherently violent and prejudiced. The juxtaposition of 'white cops' with 'klansmen' is particularly provocative, as it equates law enforcement officers with a hate group. This indirectly promotes prejudice against white cops by associating them with a notorious white supremacist group, which fits the criteria for implicit hate speech."
15742,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses euphemistic and coded language to present Adolf Hitler in a positive light, which indirectly normalizes or promotes his actions. This can be seen as a form of implicit abuse given the widespread understanding of Hitler's atrocities.

9303,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against white people by equating them with white supremacists. The use of hashtags '#antiwhite' and '#antifa' adds to the provocative nature, aiming to polarize and stir controversy. This interpretation is most consistent with the definition of implicit hate speech."
12167,not_hate,0.9,The text primarily criticizes President Obama's policy omission regarding pro-life issues in his State of the Union address. The phrase 'aborting the future' is metaphorical and does not target any protected category with abuse. It is a political critique rather than an attack on a group based on their protected characteristics.
13424,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that Muslims are responsible for the harm and death of white people. The phrase 'mangled and wounded and dead white people' clearly indicates harm and violence directed towards white individuals, and 'the lost Muslims should be nearby' implies that Muslims are in close proximity to the violence, suggesting they are the perpetrators. The use of the word 'lost' could be interpreted as a derogatory term, implying that Muslims are misguided or dangerous. This interpretation aligns with the analysis that the text falls under the subtype of 'Perpetrators,' depicting Muslims as responsible for violence against white people."
6726,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to incite action or reaction against 'antifa,' which is a group often associated with political and social activism. The phrase 'actually' sets the stage for a revelation meant to shock or surprise the audience, and the accusation of a violent act by 'antifa' is designed to provoke a strong emotional response. The mention of 'pics and videos' adds a sense of urgency and authenticity, encouraging the audience to take action against the group. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language to promote prejudice and incite action against a protected category."
11423,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text promotes a racist and xenophobic narrative, expressing fear and hatred towards non-white populations. The phrase 'the death of white civilisation' implies a belief in the decline of white dominance, which is often used to incite fear and hatred. The hashtag '#swrm' stands for 'Stormfront,' a well-known white supremacist forum, indicating a connection to racist ideologies.

21157,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses a pop culture reference to make a derogatory statement about black people lacking rights, which perpetuates a harmful stereotype.

12763,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'this country was founded by whites for whites read federalist no 2' uses coded language and abstract references to promote a racist and exclusionary sentiment. The phrase 'founded by whites for whites' explicitly suggests that the country belongs to white people and was intended for them, which is a prejudicial attitude. The reference to 'read federalist no 2' adds a layer of historical context, implying that the country's founding principles were racially exclusive. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
19572,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to generalize a group of people as having certain negative characteristics. The phrase 'they'll sell the country over anal sex' and the term 'total degenerate pigs' reinforce negative stereotypes and dehumanize the group in question, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
16796,not_hate,0.85,"The text mentions 'jews of european ancestry' in a way that could be interpreted as a social commentary on inclusivity or exclusivity. The rhetorical question and enthusiastic statements suggest a focus on identity and inclusivity rather than promoting prejudice. The context implies that the speaker is commenting on the social dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, which does not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
1082,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a 'white history month,' which implicitly pits one racial group against another, creating a sense of division and tension.

16377,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text conveys a derogatory and divisive viewpoint about race and political strategy, implying that Democrats have a hidden agenda to change the demographic makeup of the country while still needing support from a group they are allegedly working against. The phrase 'turn America non-white' has a derogatory undertone, suggesting a negative view of demographic change. The need for 'white votes' implies a divisive strategy, where Democrats are seen as manipulating different groups for political gain. This interpretation is supported by the analysis that the text falls under the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' relying on cultural and social knowledge to convey an abusive implication."

19185,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards people from developing countries. The term 'cesspool' is a degrading metaphor, and the phrase '3rd world habits' generalizes and stereotypes these individuals, implying that their habits are inferior and harmful. The quotation marks around 'diversity' suggest a dismissive tone towards the concept, further reinforcing the negative stereotypes."
1818,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text depicts a specific identity group (white men) as responsible for a crime or immoral act (attacking women). This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse where perpetrators are depicted as responsible for crimes or immoral acts.

12407,implicit_hate,0.75,"The term 'identitarians' is often used pejoratively to dismiss or belittle individuals who advocate for social justice or identity-based rights. The phrase 'i just call them identitarians' suggests a dismissive attitude towards these advocates. The statement 'for better or worse i was born european white' can be seen as a subtle assertion of superiority or entitlement, implying that being European and white is a significant factor in the speaker's identity and possibly their worldview.

11621,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses insinuation to imply that the recipient is racist and supports white supremacy, which is a form of implicit abuse. The phrase 'u clearly support both of those things' is not a direct statement but an inference based on the context. The text does not provide specific examples or evidence of the recipient's actions or statements that support racism or white supremacy. The use of 'so off' suggests that the speaker is emotionally affected, but the accusation is made in a way that leaves room for interpretation, making it implicit rather than explicit."
13116,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text mentions Adolf Hitler, a figure widely associated with the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities, and a 'secret Ukrainian bunker,' which could imply a hidden or secretive association between Ukraine and Nazi ideology.

14270,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily expresses a personal grievance and frustration about being doxxed and dismissed from a job due to political beliefs. While the term 'alt-right' is associated with far-right extremist views, the text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The focus is on the speaker's experience and feelings of unfair treatment, rather than promoting hate or discrimination."
20871,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'Waiting for riots? White girl fatally stabbed at gov't school by...' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The phrase 'Waiting for riots?' implies an expectation or anticipation of a violent reaction. The mention of a 'White girl' being fatally stabbed at a government school suggests a racially charged context. The ellipsis ('by...') leaves the identity of the perpetrator ambiguous, which can be interpreted as a deliberate omission to allow readers to fill in the blanks with their own biases. The combination of these elements can be seen as an attempt to provoke negative sentiments and blame towards a specific group, likely based on racial or ethnic lines."
4191,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily criticizes an individual for perceived dishonesty and manipulation in promoting an agenda, which is more aligned with political criticism or personal disappointment rather than targeting a protected category. The term 'huckster' is derogatory but does not specifically target any protected characteristics. The phrase 'gope agenda' is ambiguous and does not clearly reference any protected category. The overall tone is one of disappointment and criticism, not hate speech."

14525,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains an implicit threat, suggesting that political figures must align with the alt-right or face failure. The phrase 'none of these people can win without the alt-right' can be seen as a veiled threat, implying that political figures must comply with the alt-right's agenda. 'so they are stuck with us' reinforces this threat, suggesting that there is no alternative to aligning with the alt-right. The context of political dependency and the alt-right's influence adds to the threatening tone."
9448,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'watch the house debate live on #hr3762 : . #defundpp #obamacare' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

13310,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'how anti-white rhetoric is fueling white nationalism : via' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly indicate implicit hate speech. The text is more likely to be an analytical or cautionary statement rather than a direct or indirect promotion of prejudice. It does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it appears to be a neutral or academic exploration of a social phenomenon."
2658,not_hate,1.0,"The text 'this is less theoretical . core is case studies of how various countries de' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

There is no indication of implicit hate speech."
17096,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a neutral report of an upcoming event, devoid of any bias or opinion, aimed at informing the public. The language is factual and does not include any emotive or biased terms. The structure is typical of a news headline, focusing on who, what, and when. The hashtag '#oregonstandoff' is used for contextualization rather than to convey a specific stance."
16829,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey a sense of racial superiority and exclusion. The phrase 'I just love mine' combined with 'racial invasion' suggests a strong preference for the speaker's own race and a disdain for the presence of other races, which is perceived as an unwelcome intrusion. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it promotes prejudice without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
6829,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to instill fear and xenophobia by suggesting that Democrats are allowing dangerous foreign elements, specifically ISIS, to infiltrate the United States. The term 'dumbocrats' is derogatory and the mention of the 'ISIS flag over the White House' is a dramatic and fear-inducing image, suggesting that extremist groups are taking control. The overall tone is alarmist, aiming to create fear and distrust towards Democrats and foreigners."
18798,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement mentions that KKK marchers, a known white supremacist hate group, will be armed at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. This can be interpreted as a call for action and intimidation, implying a readiness for conflict and serving as a warning or threat to those who might oppose the KKK's presence. The historical context of racial tensions in Charlottesville amplifies the potential for violence, making this an implicit form of hate speech."
2562,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text is implicitly stereotyping Jews by suggesting that being white and pro-white is unusual for them. This implies a generalization that Jews are typically not white or pro-white, which can be seen as a form of racial stereotyping. The subtle implication that Jews are not typically white or pro-white can be interpreted as a coded form of anti-Semitism or racial stereotyping."
9387,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text aims to portray white people as victims, suggesting that they are unfairly targeted and oppressed, thereby minimizing the struggles of other marginalized groups. The claim that white people are 'the most hated & oppressed group in the us' directly positions them as victims, which can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice by deflecting attention from the genuine oppression faced by other groups."
2799,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text generalizes the behavior and beliefs of Hindus by suggesting that they would not vote for the BJP under certain conditions. This generalization implies a stereotypical view of Hindus' political and religious preferences, which is a form of stereotyping and can be considered implicit hate speech."
544,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'it's us white gentiles getting screwed!' uses coded language and an 'us vs. them' mentality, which can be interpreted as a subtle form of racism or bigotry. The phrase 'getting screwed' suggests a sense of unfair treatment, and the term 'white gentiles' creates a distinction from other groups, implying resentment or hostility towards them. This aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, including abstract references and appeals to racist attitudes without explicit language."
5300,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language to convey a racist message without being explicitly racist. The phrase 'impending genocide of the white race' relies on cultural and social contexts to suggest a racial hierarchy and the idea that white people are under threat from other groups. This coded language can incite fear and hatred without being overtly racist, making it more palatable to a broader audience."
4143,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes towards white people. The phrase 'i howl at all the white doing the die in in ferg.they think they not bigots .' suggests dehumanization through the use of 'howl,' a dismissive attitude towards death, and an underlying accusation of racism or prejudice. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
3417,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'fuhrer' is historically associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. By suggesting that India needs a 'fuhrer,' the statement implies a desire for a strong, authoritarian leader, which is highly offensive and abusive due to its historical context and association with fascism and totalitarianism."
12187,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that convey prejudicial attitudes towards the white race. The phrase 'they are proud of the fact that the white race is being led to its death' suggests a harmful outcome and an endorsement of this outcome, aligning with the definition of implicit hate speech. The use of 'proud' and the incomplete phrase 'the greatest race to eve ...' further emphasize a derogatory sentiment and potential supremacist ideology."
1939,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to highlight the lack of diversity and the prevalence of certain demographics in positions of power, which is a form of social commentary rather than implicit hate speech. The speaker is critiquing the situation rather than promoting prejudice."
6469,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implicitly accuses Islam of being intolerant and suggests that the burden of tolerance should not solely be on the general public. This interpretation aligns with the subtype of Perpetrators, where Islam is implied to be responsible for intolerance or immoral acts. The use of rhetorical questions and the implication that Islam is not being held to the same standard of tolerance suggest a coded and indirect way of promoting prejudice."
8026,not_hate,0.95,"The text advocates for free speech and clarifies that criticizing white supremacists is not an attack on all white people. It does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

15279,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that certain actions have set back progress for white people and benefited those who exploit racial issues. The use of the word 'kill' and the phrase 'set white people back a 100 yrs' are provocative and suggest a significant setback for a specific racial group. The term 'race baiters' is used to dismiss or belittle discussions about racial issues, implying that the actions have benefited those who exploit racial tensions. The overall tone is inflammatory and intended to provoke a reaction."
15782,not_hate,0.95,"The text does not target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.

This statement uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against a protected category, aligning with the definition of implicit hate speech."
3665,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a racial hierarchy by implying that white people are inherently more constructive and valuable than other groups. The juxtaposition of 'white people build up' and 'we don't tear down' creates a contrast that can be interpreted as a racial hierarchy, where white people are seen as superior builders, and other groups are not. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice."
18265,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses repetitive and generalized references to violence, specifically targeting an unspecified group and mentioning Christians as victims. This aligns with the use of coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech. The text dehumanizes the targeted group by portraying them as inherently violent, which is a common tactic in extremist rhetoric and political propaganda."
12209,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text mentions Adolf Hitler's plan to assassinate key Allied leaders, which could be seen as glorifying his actions. The hashtags '#swrm' and '#hitler' might be interpreted as promoting or endorsing Hitler's ideologies. The context and tone of the text do not explicitly condemn Hitler's actions, which could be seen as trivializing his crimes. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
3143,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that promote racial supremacy and express genocidal wishes. The phrases 'start having white babies' and 'start to pry for spontaneous mass suicide of all the people you hate' are direct calls to action that encourage harmful behavior and dehumanize certain groups. The statement 'if you dont like it move' is dismissive and suggests that the presence of certain groups is unwanted, reinforcing a prejudicial attitude."
2735,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text promotes a racist and supremacist ideology by suggesting that the current state of a group of people is inherently inferior and that the only way to improve their situation is through the dominance of white culture. This interpretation is supported by the derogatory generalization in the phrase 'what you see today is close to their natural state' and the suggestion to 'support white cultural hegemony,' which reinforces the idea of white cultural superiority."
12735,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text endorses the disruptive actions caused by Milo Yiannopoulos at Berkeley and celebrates the positive impact it had on the alt-right movement. The phrase 'very positive for the altright' implies that the disruption was beneficial for the alt-right movement, which is associated with far-right ideologies. The overall tone suggests an endorsement of the disruptive actions, aligning with the category of implicit abuse."
9901,not_hate,0.9,"The text aims to educate the reader about the distinction between race and skin color, emphasizing that race is more about ancestry and lineage rather than physical appearance. It uses the example of African albinos to illustrate that skin color alone does not define race. The phrase 'a convenient signifier' suggests that skin color is often used as a shorthand for race but is not the defining factor. The text concludes by reinforcing that skin color does not equate to racial identity."
17427,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'white ones i bet .' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to convey a derogatory generalization about white people. The phrase 'white ones' refers to a group based on their race, and the addition of 'i bet' suggests a sarcastic or mocking tone, implying a negative or derogatory assumption about the group. This aligns with the subtype of Stereotypes, which is a key feature of implicit hate speech."
15348,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward question asking about the visibility of something that was taken down. There are no derogatory terms, generalizations, or calls for harmful actions, indicating a neutral tone. The phrase 'obviously it wasn't going to be permanent' suggests that the speaker acknowledges the temporary nature of the content, and the question 'how many people saw it until you took it down?' is a direct inquiry about the reach or impact of the content before it was removed."
20921,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text discusses the idea of 'purging them from society,' which is a direct reference to eliminating a group of people. The phrase 'free genocide card' explicitly mentions genocide, indicating a call for extreme violence. The statement 'no one would ever blame us' suggests that the speaker believes there would be no repercussions for such actions, implying a justification for genocide. This interpretation is the most consistent with the text's use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
21075,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text relies on a negative stereotype about Jews being overly interested in money, which is a common derogatory stereotype. The joke's punchline reinforces this stereotype, making it an example of implicit hate speech. The humor is derived from the implied insult or harm directed at Jews, which can be seen as abusive."
227,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote white supremacy and align with Nazi ideology, which are forms of implicit hate speech. The terms 'white pride america' and 'national socialist movement' are historically and culturally significant in promoting prejudice against protected categories, particularly racial and religious groups."
10107,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text lists various white ethnic groups, which could be interpreted as emphasizing whiteness. The question 'are all white subcultures welcome to your party?' could be seen as a way to subtly exclude non-white individuals by focusing on the inclusion of white subcultures. The phrase 'the list goes on' could be interpreted as a dismissive gesture towards non-white groups, implying that only white subcultures are being considered."
16183,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'killa white skin head' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its use of coded language and abstract references that convey prejudicial attitudes. The term 'killa' suggests violence or aggression, and 'white skin head' can be a derogatory descriptor targeting individuals based on their appearance and perceived subcultural affiliation. This combination can incite fear or promote negative stereotypes, aligning with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
5797,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text implies that non-white immigration poses a threat to the white race, suggesting that the presence of non-white immigrants is harmful and could lead to the 'extermination' of the white race. This interpretation uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against non-white immigrants, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."
7783,implicit_hate,0.9,"The phrase '#withjewswelose' explicitly states that 'with Jews we lose,' implying that the presence or actions of Jewish people result in failure or harm. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Perpetrators,' where an identity group is depicted as responsible for crimes or immoral acts. The context of 'Greville Janner update' and 'The Occidental Observer' (a publication known for its anti-Semitic content) further supports the idea that the text is meant to propagate anti-Semitic views."
16322,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'so potus right and media wrong again ?' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. It primarily focuses on criticizing the media and defending POTUS, which does not fall under the definition of implicit hate speech."
15632,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as a sarcastic commentary on media bias, critiquing how media outlets often portray black neighborhoods in a negative light. The phrase 'im sorry black america' is meant to mock the media's tendency to sensationalize stories involving race, rather than promoting prejudice or hate."
12152,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to the concept of an ethnostate, which is often associated with discriminatory ideologies. The sarcastic or mocking tone, as well as the critical stance, suggest an implicit prejudicial attitude towards the idea of an ethnostate. The use of 'ah' and 'photographic evidence' in a satirical context further supports this interpretation."
20478,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies a dismissive and derogatory attitude towards a group of people, suggesting they are not worthy of consideration or respect. The phrase 'not even a ticket' suggests that the speaker believes the group does not deserve any form of recognition or reward.

There is no evidence of implicit hate speech based on the provided definitions and guidelines."
15748,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly implies that Muslims are inherently violent or intolerant, using the term 'jihad' in a derogatory manner. The mention of 'islamic jihad groups' attacking a monastery could be interpreted as a coded way to criticize or insult Muslims. The context of 'interfaith outreach' suggests a broader critique of religious tolerance, potentially implying that Muslims are the aggressors."
5589,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text generalizes that 'all nonwhites hate you and like white genocide,' which is a stereotypical belief about a large group of people. This generalization is a form of implicit abuse because it paints an entire demographic with a broad, negative brush. The phrase 'like white genocide' is highly provocative and can be interpreted as a call for harmful action against a specific group, although it is more indirectly stated. This suggests an intent to incite fear or anger."
20088,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that immigrants are unwelcome and dangerous, promoting prejudice against them.

4159,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote the idea of a racially homogeneous society, which is exclusionary and discriminatory. The phrase 'white ethno state' and the implication that such a state would be 'peaceful and friendly' suggest a prejudicial attitude towards non-white individuals. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
16189,implicit_hate,0.85,"The League of the South has been linked to white supremacist ideologies, and Montgomery, Alabama, has a significant African American population and a history of civil rights struggles.

1690,not_hate,0.95,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a neutral observation about the effectiveness of public rallies and the speaker's self-awareness of not fitting the typical attendee profile. The phrase 'loners like me' does not target any protected category and is more about personal preference rather than prejudice."
4198,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'is a open white nationalists website sir ...' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The term 'white nationalists' is used in a way that is likely to be controversial or offensive, and the use of 'sir' adds a layer of formality that could be intended to provoke a reaction.

13646,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'the koran in america is not the true koran . there koran teaches them to convert us or kill u' uses coded language and stereotypes to promote fear and mistrust towards Muslims. The phrase 'the koran in america is not the true koran' delegitimizes the Koran and, by extension, Muslims in America. The statement 'there koran teaches them to convert us or kill u' reinforces harmful stereotypes about Muslims being violent and intolerant. The use of 'them' and 'us' creates an 'us vs. them' mentality, furthering the divide and promoting fear. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
7789,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text contains direct incitement to violence against white men and a generalization that Muslims are untrustworthy.

7183,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes. The term 'national socialist' is a coded reference to Nazis, which carries a strong negative connotation. The term 'senile' is used derogatorily to insult someone's mental capacity. 'Go to Syria' can be interpreted as a wish for harm, given the context of Syria's conflicts and instability. The combination suggests a malicious intent, wishing harm upon the targeted individual."
8528,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and euphemisms such as 'white supremacists,' 'white nationalists,' and 'race realists,' which are well-known within racist communities. The phrase 'a few real' can be seen as an attempt to downplay the prevalence and significance of these ideologies, normalize racist beliefs, and signal to like-minded individuals without drawing too much attention or criticism. This aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, including abstract or coded references and appeals to racist attitudes without explicit language."

10803,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language ('RAHOWA') and abstract references to a 'desired race war,' which are indirect ways of promoting prejudice and inciting racial tensions. The context of skinheads and white supremacists, known for their violent ideologies, supports this interpretation."
5630,implicit_hate,0.9,"The phrase 'white elitist' and the accusation of being a 'hate group hellbent on promoting white supremacy' are indirect but clear references to negative stereotypes and harmful ideologies. The use of 'reaffirm' suggests a continuation of a perceived pattern of behavior, adding to the implicit nature of the hate speech."
11099,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text expresses direct hostility and an implicit threat. The speaker is explicitly stating their hatred towards a group and implicitly threatening them by suggesting they would elect a harmful figure (Darth Vader) just to cause distress. The phrase 'you people don't understand how much we hate you' is direct and explicit in its hostility, and the phrase 'we'd elect darth vedar just to spite you' is implicitly abusive because it relies on cultural knowledge of Darth Vader, a villainous character from Star Wars. The implication is that the speaker would choose someone evil or harmful just to cause distress or harm to the group being addressed."
9658,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term '#cuckservative,' which is often used to insult conservatives who are perceived as not being true to conservative principles.

The context suggests mockery and degradation of a group based on their political beliefs, which can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice."
18359,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses the term 'white genocide,' which is a coded phrase often used by far-right groups to imply that increasing diversity is a form of genocide against white people. The phrase 'accelerates' adds a sense of urgency, and the statistic 'at least 1 in 3 newborns are non-white' is framed as evidence of a perceived threat. The call to 'read more' suggests mobilization and engagement with a larger narrative aimed at promoting fear and racial supremacy."
10771,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'join the sn movement' is a subtle reference to the Southern Nationalist movement, which is often associated with white supremacist and neo-Confederate ideologies. The context of moving back to the South and referencing ancestors suggests a connection to historical and cultural narratives that may be divisive. The overall tone of disillusionment with current politics could be a pretext for aligning with more extreme or divisive political views."
20759,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text conveys a derogatory and dehumanizing attitude towards immigrants, implying that their presence is undesirable. The phrase 'ridding our country of all illegal immigrants' uses language that dehumanizes immigrants by treating them as a problem to be eliminated.

12182,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references to ideologies that are often associated with racist and discriminatory views. The comparison of Southern nationalism with white nationalism and Nazism, and the suggestion that Southern nationalism has a better chance of succeeding, implies a preference for an ideology that has historical and cultural connotations related to racism and discrimination. This can be seen as promoting prejudice indirectly."
13626,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'that looks like white people kicking. sorry pal.' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'white people kicking' can be interpreted as a metaphor for white people dominating or being unfairly favored, which aligns with the concept of implicit abuse through stereotyping.

16234,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'new terror groups more networked advance : m k narayanan' is a straightforward, informative statement about new terror groups becoming more networked. It mentions 'new terror groups' and 'more networked,' suggesting a factual update about the organizational structure of these groups. The attribution to 'm k narayanan' indicates that this information is likely sourced from or endorsed by someone named M. K. Narayanan, possibly an expert or authority in the field. The term 'advance' could imply progress or development in the networking capabilities of these groups.

The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
4644,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards liberals and racial groups. The phrase 'liberal plantation' is a derogatory stereotype, and 'traitor to your race' implies a negative judgment about someone's loyalty to their racial group. The use of 'kidding' does not mitigate the abusive implication, and the final statement 'gawd i hate these lefties' confirms the speaker's genuine dislike for liberals, reinforcing the hostile intent."
2954,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'cuck,' which is a highly offensive slur often used to attack someone's masculinity and strength.

9359,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text dismisses concerns about racism by suggesting that logical arguments are unfairly labeled as racist. This dismissal can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice by invalidating the experiences and concerns of those who raise issues about racism. The analogy of a doctor telling a fat person they are fine further reinforces the idea that avoiding uncomfortable truths is harmful, which can be interpreted as a coded message that discussions about racism are unnecessary or exaggerated."
675,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'report trump sought visas to import at least 1100 foreign workers into usa' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
15645,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text implies that it is unnecessary to ensure equal service to same-sex couples, which can be seen as derogatory towards the LGBTQ+ community.

5358,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as a criticism of racial stereotyping. The phrase 'straight racist!' is a direct accusation of racism, and the statement 'because they're all white it must be a lie' is presented as an example of the kind of racial bias the speaker is criticizing.

The phrase 'but fits in' could mean that such stereotypes are unfortunately common, but the speaker is highlighting the absurdity of it."
16680,not_hate,0.85,"The text is intended to critique and expose the racist language used by the person being referred to.

While it references a protected category (white people), it does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The question is straightforward and does not inherently contain sarcasm or criticism, allowing for the possibility that it is a genuine request for information."
14839,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text dehumanizes the experience of slavery by reducing it to a mere comparison with other forms of labor, minimizing the suffering and injustice endured by enslaved people. This interpretation is the most consistent with implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and abstract references to downplay the severity of slavery, which is a form of prejudice against a protected category."
7289,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to associate Democrats with white nationalists, which is a form of implicit hate speech.

7590,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice against Islam, which is a protected category. The statement 'islam is all about hate' is a derogatory generalization that can be interpreted as abusive and offensive.

The contrast with Jehovah's Witnesses may be a deliberate attempt to create division and conflict between different religious groups."
11696,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses strong, derogatory labels such as 'racist,' 'white supremacist,' 'Russian,' and 'Hillary troll bots,' which are commonly used in political discourse to criticize and demean opponents. The generalization of these labels to all Trump supporters suggests a broad critique of the group. The use of such labels requires cultural and political context to understand the derogatory implications, indicating a deliberate attempt to insult and demean. The text is framed in a way that generalizes and stereotypes a large group of people, which is a common tactic in trolling.

The hashtags #syria and #russia suggest a broader context where such labeling could have significant implications."
13292,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as political satire. It uses humor to critique political figures and their actions, which is a common trait of political satirists.

The overall tone could be seen as promoting racial tension and division."
19713,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcastic and dismissive language to indirectly insult the intelligence of people who support LGBT-friendly practices.

This implies a belief in the superiority of the 'Aryan race' and the inferiority of other racial groups. The term 'Aryans' has historical and cultural associations with white supremacist ideologies, particularly those promoted by Nazi Germany. The phrase 'only aryans are invited' explicitly excludes other racial groups, suggesting that they are not considered acceptable or superior. The statement 'white and black is none of our business' further emphasizes the exclusion of these groups, reinforcing the idea that they are irrelevant or inferior."

4614,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'why putting sexual orientation and gender identity in the same category as race or religion is a problem :' can be interpreted in multiple ways, none of which clearly indicate implicit hate speech. The text does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

1194,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly highlights racial disparity or tokenism, implying a critical or negative view of the situation. The phrase 'just one black guy in the back' can be interpreted as emphasizing the isolation or underrepresentation of the black individual. The use of 'just' suggests a minimization of the black individual's presence, which can be seen as implicitly abusive. The positioning 'in the back' might imply a lesser or marginalized role, adding to the sense of disparity."
688,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'blot in the name of india' suggests that Ravish is seen as a threat to the country's honor, which can be interpreted as dehumanizing and promoting nationalistic prejudice. The term 'fraud' and the phrase 'shame on this' add layers of personal attack and public condemnation, reinforcing negative stereotypes and inciting fear or outrage."
902,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'why is border wall plan so popular w / these hispanic voters ?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning paths suggest that it is a genuine inquiry, neutral observation, or seeking clarification. These interpretations do not involve coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Therefore, it is classified as not implicit hate speech."
20336,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and relies on cultural and social context to convey a derogatory and abusive message. The term 'illegal parents' is derogatory and dehumanizing, as it labels undocumented immigrants as 'illegal,' which is a pejorative term. The statement implies that these individuals are unwanted and should be removed from the country, which is inherently abusive and demeaning. The overall message relies on the listener's understanding of the social and cultural context to infer the derogatory intent, aligning with Other Implicit Abuse."
13133,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to provoke and insult the audience by accusing them of being racist and hateful. The statement 'americans kill more americans than muslims' is provocative and suggests that Americans are more dangerous to each other. The phrase 'you're a bunch of racist hicks' is an insult that generalizes the audience as racist and hateful, which aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech."
6723,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily focuses on criticizing political leadership and dynamics within the AAP, using sarcasm to highlight hypocrisy and call for accountability. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories.

19227,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the #blacklivesmatter hashtag ironically to belittle and insult the audience, followed by derogatory language and a call for harmful action. This combination of sarcasm and insults indirectly promotes prejudice against the Black Lives Matter movement and its supporters."
10968,not_hate,0.9,"The text uses sarcasm and irony to critique the absurdity of racial stereotypes and double standards, rather than promoting prejudice. It does not contain coded language or abstract references that convey prejudicial attitudes. Instead, it highlights the flaws in labeling someone as racist based on unfounded assumptions."
4124,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'i am very disappointed that the next president is making these negative comments . plea' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories.

2462,not_hate,0.85,"The text lists soldiers of different racial and religious backgrounds and the phrase 'no the west in general' could be interpreted as a call to move beyond categorizations and focus on unity. The juxtaposition of 'white soldier,' 'black soldier,' and 'jew soldier' might be a way to emphasize that all soldiers, regardless of their background, are part of the same military force. The text could be advocating for a more inclusive and unified approach to military service."
15828,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text highlights the ethnicity of the criminals, which can be interpreted as singling out a specific group. The high percentage (84%) can be used to reinforce existing biases and stereotypes about non-white individuals being more prone to criminal behavior. The statement relies on cultural and social knowledge to imply a negative stereotype, aligning with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse.'"
16302,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about white people, suggesting a stereotype about their perceived dominance and need for support. The statement implies that all white people are dominant and that this dominance is under threat, which is a stereotype. The use of the term 'dominance' suggests a preconceived notion about the power dynamics involving white people, reinforcing the idea of stereotyping."
1950,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily makes a statistical observation about the ancestry of white people, suggesting that a majority have straightforward ancestry. The phrase 'you're talking 10 %' could refer to the percentage of white people whose ancestry is more complex, contrasting with the majority. This interpretation focuses on the statistical aspect rather than any implicit abuse or dismissive attitude."
16,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily discusses the legal and moral implications of Hobby Lobby's stance on contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs. It does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The interpretations provided do not suggest any form of implicit hate speech."
7575,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'caleb russell inspires next #cair bus ad : #myjihad is to kill all the white people on this bus' uses coded language and abstract references to incite fear and division among different racial and religious groups. The use of '#myjihad' and the reference to 'CAIR' suggest a connection to Islamic extremism, which is intended to provoke fear, mistrust, and conflict. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
1270,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily focuses on political criticism and self-praise, with no direct or indirect references to protected categories such as race, religion, or ethnicity. The statement is aimed at portraying Narendra Modi's composure and cultural values in contrast to the Congress party's behavior, without promoting prejudice or using coded language to target any protected group."
1193,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'white Muslim' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it reinforces stereotypes, suggests cultural betrayal, highlights racial and religious tensions, questions identity, and socially excludes the individual. These interpretations collectively indicate coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice."
1707,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text generalizes a negative behavior (opposing free speech) to all Jews, implying a stereotype about the group. This generalization is a form of stereotyping, which is a common type of implicit abuse. The statement relies on cultural and social knowledge to interpret the abusive intent, as it assumes that the reader understands the negative connotation associated with the stereotype. Additionally, the text extends this negative behavior to all Jews, reinforcing anti-Semitic sentiment and aiming to provoke negative emotions and reactions."
11936,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses the coded phrase 'white genocide,' which is often associated with extremist ideologies that view the increase in non-white populations as a threat. The demographic data is presented in a way that supports this harmful narrative, aiming to spread fear and anxiety among the white population. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses abstract references and misinformation to promote prejudice."
920,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly mentions 'ethnostate,' a term commonly associated with white nationalist or supremacist ideologies. The phrase 'someday we'll have franchises all across the ethnostate' suggests a future vision of business success within a segregated state, implying a shared goal of ethnic segregation. The use of 'brother' reinforces this camaraderie and shared vision."
1462,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'it's white history month' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to dismiss the importance of diversity and inclusion. The euphemistic construction interpretation suggests that the speaker is implying that white history is the default or only history worth recognizing, which undermines the significance of recognizing and celebrating the history and contributions of other racial and ethnic groups. The sarcastic interpretation critiques or mocks the concept of celebrating specific racial or ethnic histories, belittling the importance of other cultural heritage months. The provocative interpretation aims to elicit a strong reaction and spark a debate, which can be seen as a way to challenge existing norms and encourage critical thinking about cultural recognition, but it does so in a way that can be perceived as dismissive and prejudicial."
19352,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to criticize religious beliefs and followers, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against a protected category (religion). The phrase 'billions of fools' is derogatory and implies that religious followers are foolish, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
12935,not_hate,0.85,"The text is more likely a defense against stereotyping rather than promoting prejudice. The mention of 'white rapists' is to counteract biases that might suggest only certain groups commit crimes, aiming to challenge and dismantle harmful stereotypes."
9142,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'two more explosions near qatif mosque ...' is neutral and factual, reporting an event without any derogatory terms, stereotypes, or calls for harmful actions.

2674,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'trump denies holocaust museums request for more funding' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a straightforward report of a political decision. While it references the Holocaust, which is a sensitive topic, the text itself does not demean, dehumanize, or incite hatred towards any protected category. The various interpretations provided do not suggest any implicit hate speech but rather explore different political, financial, and strategic motivations behind the decision."
10681,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses dismissive language and derogatory terms to avoid discussions about race, which can be seen as promoting prejudice indirectly. The phrase 'i am sick of talking abt black ppl' and the use of 'juvenile libtard' are coded references that convey a dismissive attitude towards discussions about race and those who engage in them. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes abstract or coded references and sarcasm to promote prejudicial attitudes."
17996,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudicial attitudes towards liberal ideologies and the concept of white privilege and guilt. It implies that these teachings are harmful and divisive, particularly targeting white teenagers. The phrase 'kids who did nothing!' reinforces the idea that white teenagers are being unfairly targeted, which can be seen as promoting a sense of victimhood and resentment."
18903,not_hate,0.9,"The term 'rube' is derogatory but does not target any protected category. The context is a political debate, and the phrase 'drenched in sweat' suggests stress or pressure, which is common in such events. None of the interpretations directly or indirectly promote prejudice against any protected category. The text is more likely a critique or satirical commentary on political events or individuals, rather than implicit hate speech."
11025,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'white ? portuguese ? give us a break' can be interpreted as expressing a dismissive or derogatory attitude towards white Portuguese people. The phrase 'give us a break' is commonly used to express exasperation or disdain, and the questioning tone implies a generalized belief or dismissive attitude towards these groups. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes."
6836,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcastic and derogatory language to criticize an individual's ideology, specifically targeting their perceived intelligence and race. The use of 'white idiot' is a coded reference to race, and the overall tone is demeaning and intended to provoke a reaction. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes through indirect and coded language."
10572,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'whites made europe' generalizes and attributes the development of Europe solely to white people, which can be seen as a stereotypical belief that overlooks the contributions of other racial and ethnic groups. The disclaimer 'i am not alt lite / alt right' does not negate the racially charged message, and the use of 'even i know' suggests that this is a commonly held belief, reinforcing the stereotype."
9449,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'nutters' to generalize and stereotype individuals associated with leftist or antifa movements. This generalization is a form of stereotyping, which is a subtype of implicit abuse. The term 'nutters' is a coded reference that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
2862,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'hamas : kill #christians & jews to the last one' uses coded language and abstract references to incite hatred and animosity towards Christians and Jews. The use of hashtags and the attribution to 'hamas' are tactics to spread the message widely and quickly, aiming to reach a broader audience and incite stronger emotions. The phrase 'to the last one' amplifies the intensity of the hatred, suggesting a desire for complete eradication."
13745,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial prejudice. The term 'coonfessional' is a derogatory play on 'confessional' combined with the racial slur 'coon,' which is highly offensive towards Black people. The phrase 'white daddy' carries racial and possibly sexual undertones, implying a subservient or dependent relationship. The combination of these terms suggests that the person being addressed is seen as inferior and is trying to curry favor with a white authority figure. This interpretation is supported by the context and the cultural and social implications of the terms used."
12733,not_hate,0.7,"The statement 'the leftist media actively supports them' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning path that could potentially be seen as implicit hate speech is Interpretation 5. This interpretation suggests that the statement subtly criticizes the group being supported by the media. However, without additional context or explicit derogatory language, it is difficult to definitively classify this as implicit hate speech. The term 'leftist media' and the phrase 'actively supports them' do not contain any direct slurs, tropes, or dehumanizing language. The statement could also be seen as a neutral observation, political commentary, or even praise for media advocacy. Therefore, the classification leans towards 'not_hate' due to the lack of clear prejudicial intent."
17314,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily criticizes the lack of diversity and the influence of wealth in politics. While it generalizes and stereotypes the political class as predominantly white and wealthy, it does not use coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice. Instead, it can be seen as a call for change or an expression of frustration with the current political landscape."
3952,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest a future threat or retribution directed towards white people. The phrase 'they'll come for your ancestors too eventually' implies a hostile or aggressive intent, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against white people based on their historical actions. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
3800,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly links conservatism to racial harm, suggesting that conservatism is inherently harmful to the white race. The incomplete phrase 'we must begi...' could be interpreted as a call for action that further divides along racial lines, promoting prejudice through coded language and abstract references."
12981,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and irony to mock Obama's defense of a group widely perceived as a hate group. The use of quotation marks around 'not racist' suggests disbelief and ridicule, implying that the group is indeed racist. This indirectly promotes prejudice by reinforcing negative stereotypes and questioning the sincerity of Obama's defense."
1431,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the educational system for omitting genocides in India, using the phrase 'does a monkey-balancing' to describe this selective approach as clumsy and insincere. While it references historical atrocities, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The focus is on educational bias rather than promoting hatred against any protected category."
9302,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'white devils' is inherently derogatory and abusive, and the question format could be a rhetorical device to convey a negative sentiment rather than seeking a genuine answer. The context of the term 'white devils' suggests a derogatory reference to white people, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
16638,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. While the tone is condescending and potentially provocative, it does not target any specific group based on race, religion, or other protected characteristics. The questions and statements are more about challenging the recipient's knowledge and credibility rather than promoting prejudice."
11997,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text groups Hispanics and Republicans together and implies that being a member of these groups is associated with racism. This generalization fits the definition of stereotyping, where certain characteristics are attributed to a group without considering individual differences. This indirectly promotes prejudice against these groups."
4004,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text reinforces the public perception that the alt-right supports Nazis by providing evidence. The phrase 'but now everyone thinks' acknowledges a current belief, and the statement 'the alt-right supports nazis' is presented as a fact. The mention of 'videos of r. spencer saying' provides concrete evidence to support this belief, which can be seen as promoting prejudice indirectly."
4662,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'your children at risk in schools - rt : lawmaker asks muslims visiting her office to take a ...' uses coded language and abstract references to imply that Muslims are a threat to children in schools. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. The phrase 'your children at risk in schools' creates a sense of danger, and the lawmaker specifically targeting Muslims for an action suggests a discriminatory attitude, implying that Muslims are responsible for the perceived risk."
11781,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'sounds like your describing white slavery as well .' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses a historically loaded and often dismissive term 'white slavery.' This term minimizes the suffering of those who have experienced actual slavery and can be seen as offensive and insensitive, especially to those with a historical or cultural connection to slavery. The use of such a term in a casual or dismissive manner can be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to stir controversy or belittle the experiences of others."
3503,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text associates 'sodomy,' a term often used in a derogatory context, with 'white identity,' which generalizes a negative characteristic to a specific racial or ethnic group. This form of stereotyping is a key feature of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
10197,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'you're not white you're tacist' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to race. The misspelling 'tacist' is likely a typo or intentional play on the word 'racist,' and the statement 'you're not white' is a direct comment on the recipient's racial identity. Combining these elements, the text suggests that the recipient is both non-white and racist, which is derogatory and offensive. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
8350,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'you should probably vet people first' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a general advice that can be applied in various contexts such as professional settings, personal safety, online interactions, community settings, legal or financial decisions, and educational settings. The advice is aimed at ensuring thorough evaluation and caution, which is a neutral and practical recommendation."
268,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text explicitly mentions a 'Muslim suicide bomber' as the perpetrator of the violence in Afghanistan, which could be seen as implicitly blaming Muslims for the violence. This depiction reinforces negative stereotypes about Muslims and could be interpreted as promoting prejudice against them."
12893,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The mention of 'the donald' and 'white nationalists' in the context of 'loving hate' suggests an alignment with divisive and hateful rhetoric. The direct call to action 'let's love hate!' can be seen as a genuine endorsement of hate, even if it is presented in a sarcastic or satirical manner. The overall tone and context imply a harmful intent, making it implicit hate speech."
11114,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language ('kkklanneed') referencing the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist hate group. It also includes a derogatory reference to undocumented immigrants ('illegals') and a call to action to report them to ICE. This combination of elements promotes prejudice and harmful action against a protected group, making it implicit hate speech."
19726,not_hate,0.85,"The text describes a scenario that is physically impossible and exaggerated, suggesting a theatrical or humorous context. The use of the word 'film' and the exaggerated nature of the description indicate that the statement is likely intended as dark humor rather than a literal call for action. While it implies harm, it does not target any specific protected category and lacks the coded language or abstract references typical of implicit hate speech."
1360,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'headed to the #savemeriam rally outside of white house now :' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The use of the hashtag '#savemeriam' and the mention of a rally outside the White House suggest support for a cause, which is not indicative of hate speech. The context and language used are consistent with advocacy and support rather than prejudice."
19200,not_hate,0.85,"While Interpretation 2 suggests dehumanization, the context and tone of the phrase 'sorry, i'd rather be a human being' do not clearly target a protected category. The statement is more likely a criticism of behavior rather than an attack on a person's inherent characteristics. The other interpretations, such as sarcasm, self-assertion, apology with a twist, irony, and expression of frustration, do not align with the criteria for implicit hate speech."
13402,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text promotes a conspiracy theory suggesting that mass migration is a deliberate plot to harm the white race and Western civilization. The use of coded language such as 'weaponized artificial mass migration' and the explicit mention of 'the white race' and 'the western world' as targets aligns with common xenophobic and racist sentiments. This interpretation is consistent with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses abstract references and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
2938,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily appears to be a promotional message for a music album or a similar product related to Donald Trump. The use of terms like 'beats,' 'the trump tapes,' and 'trumpless (instrumental) version' suggests a musical context rather than any form of hate speech. The call to action 'get it here' is typical for promotional material. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice that would classify this as implicit hate speech."
4598,not_hate,0.7,"The text 'white people's .' is incomplete and lacks sufficient context to definitively classify it as implicit hate speech. The most consistent reasoning path is that it could be the beginning of a neutral or descriptive statement about white people. The ellipsis might indicate a pause before continuing with a factual or neutral description, such as 'white people's culture' or 'white people's traditions.' Without additional context, it is possible that the text is not intended to be derogatory but rather informative or descriptive."
8226,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the tendency of a small, paranoid group on platforms like 4chan to dismiss any event or person as insincere or manipulative, regardless of the evidence. It does not target any protected category or use coded language to promote prejudice."
18149,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'sad that has not suspended this account #kkk cc' is most consistently interpreted as a call for action against racist content, criticism of platform moderation, expression of frustration, sarcastic commentary, or an attempt to draw attention to the issue. The use of the hashtag '#kkk' is a reference to the Ku Klux Klan, which is a clear indicator of the context being about racist content. However, the overall tone and intent of the text are directed towards criticizing the platform's inaction rather than promoting or endorsing hateful ideologies. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
4019,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily criticizes political figures for their perceived ignorance and unsportsmanlike behavior. While it uses comparisons and generalizations, it does not target individuals based on their membership in protected categories.

There is no evidence of implicit hate speech."
6182,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward presentation of demographic data from the CDC, highlighting a concerning trend among white Americans aged 45-55. There are no elements of sarcasm, rhetorical questions, or coded language that would suggest implicit abuse. The text emphasizes the 'alarming rate' of mortality among a specific demographic group, suggesting urgency and a need for action. The comparison with other demographic groups highlights the severity of the issue, aligning with the role of the CDC in monitoring and alerting the public to health trends. The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
5555,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'why would a mexican president welcome the loss of migrating citizens?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations provided suggest implicit hate speech. The text primarily questions the actions or policies of the Mexican president, which can be seen as criticism of leadership, questioning economic policies, political satire, concern for national interests, or highlighting policy failures. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The focus is on political critique rather than targeting individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics."
4682,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text attempts to revise the historical narrative of Adolf Hitler, portraying him in a positive light despite his well-documented atrocities. The phrase 'the man who loved his people and who was loved dearly by them in return' suggests a positive portrayal of Hitler. The use of the hashtag '#hitler' in a positive context reinforces this interpretation. The statement 'don't believe the lies against him' implies that the commonly accepted negative portrayal of Hitler is false. This aligns with the concept of 'Euphemistic Constructions,' where harmful actions and ideologies are disguised or downplayed."
18035,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'market forces drive wages ann. [excluding gov intervention - marxism]' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The text is primarily an economic analysis or critique of government intervention, framed within Marxist economic theory. There are no elements that suggest implicit hate speech."
10369,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against non-white individuals. The term 'non-white invasion' is highly charged and implies a hostile takeover, which is often used in xenophobic rhetoric.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."

15923,not_hate,0.95,"The text uses sarcasm to critique racist hate groups, highlighting their negative impact on racial harmony. The use of 'right' and 'smh' indicates disapproval and frustration, suggesting the speaker is against such groups. The literal statement 'a racist hate group will calm racial strife' is absurd, implying the opposite is true. The contextual clues and logical inference support the interpretation that the speaker is critiquing rather than promoting prejudice."
8799,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory language ('stupid group of people') and calls for mistreatment ('they deserve to be mistreated'), which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The context suggests targeting marginalized groups, such as undocumented immigrants, reinforcing negative stereotypes and dehumanization."
9067,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily critiques the media's influence and manipulation over the past 70-80 years, expressing disillusionment with societal beliefs and historical narratives. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The language is abstract but does not target any specific group based on race, religion, or other protected characteristics."
5832,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'another white heritage month has come and gone. #activism for our people continues! #workingclass' can be interpreted as a sarcastic critique of white privilege. The phrase 'white heritage month' is not an official or recognized celebration, and the use of 'another' suggests repetition, implying that the concept is absurd or unnecessary. The hashtags '#activism for our people' and '#workingclass' suggest a mocking tone, critiquing the idea that white people need a special month to celebrate their heritage, unlike other ethnic or cultural groups. This interpretation does not promote prejudice but rather critiques the notion of white privilege."
353,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'come together white people or perish' uses coded language and abstract references to create a sense of fear and urgency among white people. The phrase 'or perish' implies a threat, which could incite fear and aggressive behavior, fostering an 'us vs. them' mentality. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it promotes prejudice indirectly."
12838,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'What are the chances any media outlet will actually show new footage?' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a rhetorical question that implies skepticism or criticism toward media outlets but does not target any protected category. The context and tone do not suggest any form of hate speech."
19171,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text dehumanizes a group by comparing them to animals and uses derogatory language to describe their hygiene practices, which are coded references to cultural stereotypes. The phrase 'damn animals' explicitly dehumanizes the group, and the descriptions of their behaviors reinforce this dehumanizing comparison. The text requires cultural and social knowledge to fully interpret the derogatory implications, indicating a deeper level of implicit abuse."
21125,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text dehumanizes Ethiopian babies by comparing their crying to a 'mid-life crisis,' which is typically associated with adults. This comparison reduces their humanity and treats them as less than human. Additionally, the text perpetuates a racial stereotype about Ethiopians having a short life expectancy, which is offensive and abusive."
9017,not_hate,0.95,"The text discusses the unveiling of a national Holocaust monument and emphasizes the importance of educating future generations about the Holocaust. The phrase 'unique horror' is used in a solemn and respectful tone, indicating a commemorative and educational purpose.

19252,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses dehumanizing language ('they are animals') and perpetuates negative stereotypes ('they don't want change' and 'goal is to spread their misery').

20741,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that Islam is an enemy that needs to be defeated, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against a religious group.

18354,implicit_hate,0.75,"The phrase 'white bread is hate' can be interpreted as a derogatory reference to white people, using coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes. The metaphorical use of 'white bread' to describe something bland or lacking in substance, combined with the strong negative sentiment of 'hate,' suggests an implicit attack on a protected category based on race."
13250,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'fat, stupid, and racist is no way to go through life, Lewis.' contains coded language and stereotypes that indirectly promote prejudice. The use of 'racist' as a descriptor, even if intended humorously or sarcastically, reinforces negative stereotypes about a protected category.

11368,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards Jewish politicians. The phrase 'typical jew politician' generalizes and stereotypes Jewish people, implying negative characteristics. The suggestion that Blumenthal is 'frightened' by questions from a white man about the judiciary carries implicitly abusive connotations, insinuating that Jewish people are inherently suspicious or untrustworthy. The use of the hashtag '#gorsuch' may imply a comparison or contrast with Neil Gorsuch, a non-Jewish Supreme Court Justice, further emphasizing the stereotype."
3855,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a straightforward, factual report of an event without any additional commentary or judgment. It specifies the number of participants, their nationality, and their ideological affiliation. There is no derogatory language, stereotypes, or calls for harmful action. The neutral tone and factual nature of the report do not convey prejudicial attitudes or promote prejudice."
3932,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'all his victims were white no ?' can be interpreted as sarcastically mocking the idea that the individual only targets white people, which could be seen as promoting prejudice through sarcasm and indirect language. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, where coded language and sarcasm are used to convey prejudicial attitudes."
14723,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'yelling about non-white people' suggests a generalized and possibly stereotypical view of non-white individuals. The act of 'yelling about' a group of people can be seen as dehumanizing, as it reduces them to a topic of contention rather than recognizing their individuality and humanity. This interpretation aligns with the analysis that the text contains elements of both stereotypes and dehumanization."
17463,not_hate,0.95,"The text critiques the inconsistent application of judgment standards to different incidents, questioning the motives behind labeling certain incidents as communal rather than criminal. It advocates for fairness and objectivity in judgment, and critiques media or public perception for biased labeling. There is no coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice that would classify it as implicit hate speech."
4651,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote white supremacist ideologies. The use of 'amerikkka' with triple 'k's, the term 'devils' to dehumanize non-white individuals, and the hashtag '#mawa' (Make America White Again) all contribute to an implicitly hateful message. The context and structure of the text suggest a racist sentiment advocating for a return to a white-dominated society."

11840,implicit_hate,0.75,"The term 'stranglehold' has a negative connotation, suggesting that the influence was oppressive or restrictive. 'Their greatest weapon' implies that the group intentionally used network television to exert control. The phrase 'absolute cultural stranglehold' suggests that the group's influence was overwhelming and potentially harmful to cultural diversity. The use of 'they' could be seen as a way to generalize and criticize the group for their actions, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
4708,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'i really hope he's white' suggests a preference for white individuals, which can be interpreted as stereotyping and holding a negative bias against non-white individuals.

16946,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to ridicule the notion of widespread support for Golden Dawn, a far-right, neo-Nazi political party. This sarcastic tone can be seen as a form of implicit abuse, targeting the party and its supporters, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
15488,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey a prejudicial message. The phrase 'low iq 3rd worlder' is a derogatory stereotype that demeans people from developing countries. The term 'antiwhite whites' is a divisive and abusive label that suggests internal racial conflict and superiority.

3278,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes that are commonly associated with anti-Semitic and racist attitudes. The term 'sabbath goy' has anti-Semitic connotations, 'Noel Ignatiev' is a reference to a controversial figure known for divisive ideas on race, and 'cucking' is a term used in alt-right circles to describe someone as weak or submissive, often with racial undertones. The combination of these terms suggests a derogatory and offensive portrayal of the person being described."
9497,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a personal attack on Duke, insinuating that his success is not genuine and that he is a manipulated figure. However, it does not target Duke based on any protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
11787,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about 'white men' having a declining life expectancy and uses a comparison to the AIDS epidemic in Africa, which can be seen as a stereotypical and generalized belief about a specific group.

21339,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly mentions 'black people' and generalizes a behavior (taking a long time to check out) to the entire group, which is a common characteristic of stereotyping.

11495,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text conveys a negative and exclusionary attitude towards certain groups, particularly immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries.

2789,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'why are you racist towards white people? why do you hate them so much?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly indicate implicit hate speech. The questions could be a genuine inquiry, an accusation, a defensive reaction, a provocation, a misunderstanding, or a rhetorical device. None of these interpretations use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The text does not target a protected category with abuse or dehumanization, nor does it incite fear or spread fearful stereotypes."

11956,implicit_hate,0.75,"The statement 'white pride and white supremacy are not even remotely the same' can be interpreted as a subtle defense or normalization of 'white pride,' which is often associated with racist ideologies. By emphasizing the distinction, it can be seen as an attempt to justify or downplay the harmful implications of 'white pride,' making it more acceptable by distancing it from the more overtly negative connotations of 'white supremacy.' This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
2581,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text perpetuates racial stereotypes about Africans being violent and hypocritical. It explicitly states that 'Africans kill elderly white man,' directly depicting Africans as perpetrators of a violent crime.

The hashtags '#swrm,' '#smh,' and '#racism' reinforce the derogatory and offensive tone, suggesting disapproval and frustration with the perceived hypocrisy."
15395,not_hate,0.85,"The use of 'reeee' and the misspelling of 'supremacist' as 'supreeemist' indicate a mocking or sarcastic tone rather than a serious accusation. The exclamation mark emphasizes this tone, suggesting that the statement is not meant to be taken seriously. In online communities, such language is often used for ridicule or playful banter rather than to promote prejudice."
8230,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly suggests that Muslims are a threat by linking the outreach to arrests of Muslims plotting crimes. This association can reinforce negative stereotypes about Muslims, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
10037,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text expresses a xenophobic sentiment, implying that immigrants or non-white individuals are negatively impacting Western societies and making white people feel unwelcome. The phrase 'they're coming to america for whatever their reasons are' suggests a dismissive attitude towards the motivations of immigrants. 'they're changing the west' implies that the presence of immigrants is causing a negative transformation in Western societies. 'whites are becoming unwelcome in their own lands' suggests that white people are being displaced or marginalized due to the influx of immigrants. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse where an identity group (immigrants or non-whites) is depicted as responsible for a perceived negative change and harm to another group (whites)."
10654,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that a specific group of people is being manipulated and controlled by a corporate agenda. Their primary purpose, according to the text, is to provide votes, and any attempt by them to assert their own political will (by nominating their own candidates) will be met with sabotage by the GOP. This interpretation includes dehumanization by reducing individuals to mere tools or objects, stripping them of their humanity and agency, and reinforces negative stereotypes by generalizing the group as serving a specific purpose and facing sabotage if they act independently."
2502,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory language ('communal bigots') to describe one group, which is likely to provoke a strong reaction. The juxtaposition of 'animal lovers' and 'communal bigots' is designed to create a stark contrast and elicit emotional responses. The sarcastic tone and the phrase 'hypocrisy unlimited' add to the provocative nature of the statement. The overall effect is to generate controversy and debate, rather than to make a nuanced argument. This interpretation aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, including the use of coded language, stereotypes, and sarcasm to promote prejudice."

14439,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against a protected category (race). The phrase 'democratic facist party of america' is a derogatory label that equates the Democratic Party with fascism, implying authoritarian and oppressive behavior. The term 'perpetuating white hate for vot' suggests that the Democratic Party is responsible for fostering racial animosity, particularly against white people. The sarcastic tone of 'should be happy' is used to reinforce the negative portrayal and make the accusation seem more credible. These elements collectively indicate implicit hate speech."

16935,not_hate,0.9,"The text aims to expose an account that is engaging in hate speech by masquerading as a member of the Jewish community. The term 'racist account' suggests that the account is spreading hate speech. 'Pretending to be a jew' indicates that the account is using a false identity to gain credibility.

11504,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'hardcore white supremacists ? seriously ?' is most consistently interpreted as a sarcastic comment.

The term 'snowflake' is often used to mock individuals perceived as overly sensitive, which can be seen as a stereotype. The overall tone is dismissive and insulting, suggesting a personal attack with underlying prejudicial attitudes."
9725,not_hate,0.85,"The text is framed as a question, inviting discussion and exploration rather than making a definitive statement. It juxtaposes two contrasting views on capitalism's impact on the 'white race' and its role in society. The use of 'death warrant' is metaphorical and not asserted as a fact. The inclusion of 'without prejudice' suggests an interest in fairness and equity. While the phrase 'death warrant of the white race' is provocative, it is not used to promote prejudice but to spark debate and critique existing power structures. The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
7072,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily advocates for religious freedom by highlighting a perceived threat to it. While it uses emotive language, it does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The focus is on raising awareness about religious freedom rather than promoting prejudice against any group."
13543,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning paths are Interpretation 1 and Interpretation 4. The statement 'pics i saw of those guys definitely weren't all white' can be seen as a straightforward observation of diversity or a neutral description without any underlying bias or negative connotations. While Interpretation 2 suggests a subtle racial bias, the context and lack of explicit prejudicial language make it less likely to be classified as implicit hate speech."
4881,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'antifa msm political establishment all on the same side' can be interpreted as a neutral observation that these groups have similar goals or interests. It does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The statement does not necessarily imply criticism or disparagement; it could just be noting a perceived alignment of interests. The neutral tone and lack of explicit judgment support this interpretation."
13769,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'where are the white women at ? ?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly indicate implicit hate speech. The text does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it could be a critique of absence, a sarcastic remark, a genuine inquiry, social commentary, or a provocative statement. The context is crucial, but based on the provided interpretations, the text does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
10982,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial conflict and fear. The phrase 'anti-white race war' and the claim that a music clip is teaching children to hate and massacre another group are typical tactics in propaganda to demonize the opposition and spread fear. This aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, which include abstract or coded references to race and the use of misinformation to promote prejudice."
17850,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies a sense of racial superiority and exclusion, suggesting that white people are inherently good or superior and that their struggles are more important or justified. The phrase 'good for us white folk' explicitly mentions 'white folk,' indicating a focus on a specific racial group. The use of 'us' implies a sense of unity and solidarity among white people. The phrase 'keep on fighting' suggests a struggle or battle, which, when combined with 'good for us white folk,' implies that the struggles of white people are justified and important. This interpretation requires cultural and social knowledge to understand the implicitly abusive nature of suggesting that one racial group is superior or more deserving than others."
3949,not_hate,1.0,"The text 'annual game between the University of Alabama and Auburn' is a straightforward description of a sporting event. It does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. All interpretations provided support the neutral and informational nature of the text, with no implicit abuse or negative connotations."
7166,not_hate,0.85,"The text discusses racial equality and moral law, which are generally associated with fairness and justice. The phrase 'misbehavior to be disciplined severely' could be seen as a critique of excessive punishment. The juxtaposition of racial equality and severe discipline might highlight the contradiction between promoting equality and using harsh punitive measures."
10908,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'the holocaust never happened ... : barricades the door :' is a clear example of Holocaust denial, which is a form of antisemitism. The phrase 'barricades the door' suggests a defensive or aggressive stance, implying that the speaker is prepared to defend their denialist position against any opposition. This combination of denial and defensive stance implies a hostile intent, requiring cultural and historical knowledge to fully understand the abusive nature of the statement."
15676,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'you got a bunch of white supremacists for new friends' uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes. The term 'white supremacists' is a highly negative and derogatory label that generalizes and stereotypes the person's new friends. This indirectly insults the person's character and values, and critiques their political or ideological views. The context suggests that the speaker is using the term to provoke a reaction or to create conflict, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
13706,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'to speak at #prolifecon : #marchforlife #tcot #ccot #prolife' primarily revolves around an announcement of speaking at a pro-life conference. The hashtags used are related to the pro-life movement and do not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The text is neutral and does not convey prejudicial attitudes or promote fearful stereotypes. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
1501,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'live-stream : march for marriage in washington d . c . lifesitenews' is a straightforward announcement of a live-stream event related to a march for marriage in Washington D.C.

The text is neutral and does not contain any implicit abuse, making it open to various interpretations based on the audience's perspective and the broader context."
3830,not_hate,0.95,"The text does not target any protected category with abuse, nor does it use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The sarcasm is directed at the meeting's validity, outcome, credibility, seriousness, or purpose, rather than any protected group."
177,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text '#altrightmeans becoming great again' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudicial attitudes. The hashtag '#altrightmeans' suggests a definition or explanation of what the alt-right stands for, and the phrase 'becoming great again' is a clear reference to the MAGA slogan. The alt-right movement is known for its far-right ideologies, which often include elements of white nationalism and racism. Combining these elements, the text implies that the alt-right movement aims to restore a perceived past greatness, which could be interpreted as a time when certain marginalized groups had fewer rights."
4745,not_hate,0.85,"The text discusses the growth and impact of the internet, which is a neutral observation about media trends. The question 'you aren't giving up your website anytime soon now are you?' could be a neutral inquiry about the person's plans for their website. The comparison between the website's attention and 'irl activisms' is a factual statement about the relative impact of online and offline activities. This interpretation does not assign any implicit abuse or criticism, viewing the text as a straightforward observation and question."
10950,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against white people. The phrases 'go back to Europe' and 'america is not white man's homeland' are indirect ways of suggesting that white people do not belong in America, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
2068,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text has racial undertones, implying that only a white person can be a savior or hero, which is culturally and socially charged. The term 'white knight' has historical and cultural connotations of a white savior, and the phrase 'our people' could be interpreted as referring to a specific racial or ethnic group. This interpretation falls under 'Other Implicit Abuse,' where the subtle language requires cultural knowledge to understand the underlying abusive implication."
12440,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'if your own daughter calls you a racist ...' is most consistently interpreted as a prompt for self-reflection rather than an attempt to promote prejudice. It encourages the person to consider the seriousness of their actions and the impact on close relationships, which aligns with the goal of addressing and mitigating racist behavior rather than perpetuating it."
10629,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and derogatory terms such as 'illegals' to dehumanize undocumented immigrants. The speaker's sarcastic tone dismisses legitimate concerns about racism, reinforcing the abusive intent by framing their views as reasonable and justified. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
19609,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'hordes' dehumanizes the group by likening them to a large, unruly mass rather than individual people. The phrase 'sponsored hordes' further dehumanizes by implying that these people are not autonomous but are being controlled or supported by external forces. The overall tone suggests a dehumanizing attitude towards immigrants, reducing them to a faceless mass rather than recognizing their individuality and humanity."
18254,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote fear and hatred against Muslims by portraying them as violent and dangerous. This indirectly incites prejudice and mistrust, aligning with the definition of implicit hate speech."
20745,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to advocate for the social exclusion and punishment of a group perceived as disloyal or harmful. The phrase 'unamerican ass' can be interpreted as a coded reference to individuals or groups perceived as not conforming to American values, which could include various protected categories such as immigrants, religious minorities, or political dissidents. The dehumanizing term 'bastards' and the call for extreme measures ('shoot to kill!!') reinforce the prejudicial attitudes and promote social exclusion."
17357,not_hate,0.9,The most consistent reasoning is that the text is a factual report or criticism of a narrative surrounding a shooting incident. It does not use language that indirectly promotes prejudice against any protected category.
17649,not_hate,0.9,"The text ': anarcho-tyranny : the corruption of charlottesville va via' can be interpreted in multiple ways, none of which directly or indirectly promote prejudice against any protected category. The term 'anarcho-tyranny' is a political term used to describe a situation where the government is both authoritarian and ineffective, and 'corruption' refers to systemic issues in governance. The mention of Charlottesville, VA, ties the text to real-world events and issues, but it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
5936,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the media or public perception of recent rallies involving Antifa, suggesting that the portrayal of these events is not based on empirical evidence. This interpretation does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
19862,not_hate,0.9,The text uses sarcasm and irony to critique the stereotype that Gulf countries are misogynistic. The use of quotation marks around 'evil' and the exaggerated tone suggest that the speaker is mocking the idea rather than promoting prejudice. The text does not contain coded language or abstract references that promote prejudice against any protected category.
20103,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains implicit abuse and discriminatory sentiment towards immigrants and undocumented individuals. The statement 'the us should not take in any more immigrants or allow illegals' is discriminatory as it targets specific groups. The phrase 'we are broke!' is a coded way of implying that these groups are a financial burden, which is derogatory. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the text is implicitly abusive and harmful towards immigrants and undocumented individuals."
5609,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes French people as having a unique and subservient relationship with Russia, using the term 'stepbrother' to imply a lesser or dependent relationship. This interpretation suggests a derogatory stereotype, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
20065,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses playful and humorous language, such as 'olly olly oxen free' and 'doing jumping jacks,' which are commonly associated with children's games and light-hearted activities. The phrase 'that'll freak them out and they will melt' is more likely a humorous exaggeration rather than a call for genuine distress or harm. The overall tone and context suggest a light-hearted, playful scenario rather than a malicious intent."
6141,implicit_hate,0.85,"The Confederate flag is widely recognized as a symbol associated with slavery and racism. The League of the South has been linked to white supremacist ideologies. Given the historical and cultural context, the demonstration could be interpreted as promoting racist and discriminatory views, falling under 'Other Implicit Abuse.'"
4410,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily discusses political commentary, calls for consistency, critiques of selective support, observations of changing alliances, and potential irony or sarcasm. None of these interpretations directly or indirectly promote prejudice against any protected category. The use of 'strange bedfellows' and the conditional statement 'if the others were consistent' do not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The text is more about political dynamics and inconsistencies rather than targeting any group based on protected characteristics."
8954,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text generalizes and stereotypes black people as criminals and uses coded language to insult and demean the Black Lives Matter movement.

12631,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to critique the notion of racial superiority among 'boring whites,' which can be seen as promoting prejudice against this group. The phrase 'boring whites' is a generalization that targets a specific racial group, and the statement about their 'lacking heritage' reinforces negative stereotypes."
3330,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The phrase 'its a sad day for white people' is provocative and intended to stir controversy. The comment 'they will say he's a racist and ignore it still' is dismissive and intended to provoke a reaction. The hashtag '#brainwashed' adds to the provocative nature of the text, suggesting that white people are easily manipulated. This interpretation fits with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' as it requires cultural and social knowledge to understand the provocative and trolling nature of the text."
9348,not_hate,0.95,"The text emphasizes the unique protections offered by the U.S. First Amendment and implicitly critiques other regimes for not providing the same level of protection for the free exercise of beliefs. However, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The critique is based on legal protections rather than targeting any specific group based on protected characteristics."
4025,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the inconsistency in applying secular principles across different regions of India, particularly highlighting the differential treatment of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). While it questions political motives and calls for consistency, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The text is more of a critique of political hypocrisy rather than an attack on any protected category."
3166,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text encourages viewers to watch a video about the alt-right movement and avoid mainstream media, which can be seen as promoting alternative media sources that may contain prejudicial attitudes or misinformation about protected categories. The use of '#altright' and the dismissal of mainstream media can be interpreted as coded language that indirectly supports or promotes ideologies that are often associated with hate speech."
20739,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'illegals' to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is dehumanizing. The specific request for 'names and addresses' suggests a potential intent to take harmful action against these individuals. The dismissal of statistical data and the focus on personal information imply a targeted and potentially threatening intent. The context and tone suggest that the action could be vigilante in nature, given the derogatory language and specific interest in personal information."
12732,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'the left wants white pipo to go away ...' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to convey a prejudicial attitude towards white people. The misspelling 'pipo' could be intentional to add a dismissive tone, and the statement implies a negative sentiment and a call for action ('go away') that is harmful and negative. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
12081,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'proliferating anti-white agenda' uses coded language and abstract references to suggest a coordinated effort against white people. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. The interpretations that suggest systemic bias, perceived victimization, racial paranoia, and provocation are most consistent with the idea of promoting prejudice indirectly."
6045,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'antifa type' as a derogatory label to stereotype the individual based on their perceived political affiliation. The term 'emotionally unstable' adds a negative connotation, reinforcing the stereotype. This combination of coded language and negative stereotyping aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
11958,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against Catholics and Jews. It suggests that white Protestants are superior and should exclude or leave behind Catholics and Jews, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The text also implies historical revisionism and fosters a sense of division and conflict, further supporting the classification."
6908,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that continued progress will lead to harmful actions against a specific group, implying a threat without explicitly naming the group. The phrase 'or worse' indicates severe consequences, and the lack of specificity about the group or actions could be a deliberate attempt to convey a threat indirectly."
2363,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the behavior of suspected white supremacists, highlighting their consistent use of swearing and personal attacks as a negative trait. It does not use coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice but rather calls out harmful behavior."
6564,not_hate,0.9,"The text uses sarcasm and indirect references to criticize organizations known for their anti-LGBTQ+ stances. The use of quotes around 'family' and the phrase 'means anti - #lgbt' suggests a critical stance against these organizations rather than promoting prejudice. The hashtag '#p2' could be a reference to a broader discussion or movement against these organizations, further emphasizing the criticism."
4810,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques economic policies and expresses dissatisfaction with political promises, particularly in relation to the working class. It does not target any protected category or use coded language to promote prejudice. The use of hashtags and the phrase 'hope and change ... for the worse' are directed at economic issues rather than any specific group based on race, religion, or other protected characteristics."
16036,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text aims to sensationalize and instill fear by portraying a cycle of violence involving specific identity groups. It explicitly mentions violent acts attributed to specific groups (German gangs and Syrian refugees), which can be seen as trying to evoke fear and mistrust towards these groups. The narrative suggests a chain reaction of violence, which can be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to create a sense of ongoing threat and instability."
19525,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dehumanize and degrade a specific group of people by likening them to animals and implying they are inferior and incapable of integrating into society. The phrase 'human ferals' directly compares people to animals, which is a common tactic in dehumanization. The mention of 'low iqs' suggests that the group is intellectually inferior, and 'no prospects for assimilation' implies that the group is incapable of integrating into society, further emphasizing their perceived inferiority."
14669,not_hate,0.95,"The text critiques the hypocrisy and inconsistency of an anti-immigration stance by pointing out that the people being referred to are not European but American. It uses sarcasm to highlight the double standards and ignorance of those holding anti-immigration views, but it does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it aims to expose flaws in the anti-immigration position through humor and satire."
6767,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly incites violence or retaliation against anarcho-communists by rallying 'ie members' to gather in Indianapolis under the guise of organizing a memorial for the vandalized POW graves monument. The term 'ie members' could refer to a group with opposing ideologies to anarcho-communists. The phrase 'got hammered' has a violent connotation, suggesting the monument was damaged. The hashtag '#anarcomm' is used to blame anarcho-communists for the vandalism. The text's call for a memorial could be a cover for organizing a retaliatory action."
16109,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to criticize the recipient's actions, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against a group of people referred to as 'toxoids.' The term 'toxoids' is likely a derogatory term for a protected category, and the speaker's departure from white nationalism due to this group highlights the negative sentiment. The recipient's promotion of 'toxoids' is seen as hypocritical, disappointing, and a serious issue that needs to be addressed, which aligns with the features of implicit hate speech."
21418,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'all Chinese people look the same' is a well-known stereotype that demeans and belittles individuals of Asian descent.

20376,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'et al-stay safe/be smart in #auburn. not concern trolling- this needs to be a total victory' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The phrase 'stay safe/be smart' is commonly used to advise caution and wise decision-making. The mention of 'Auburn' suggests a specific location, and the phrase 'not concern trolling' indicates sincerity. The statement 'this needs to be a total victory' suggests a strong desire for a positive outcome, which could be related to safety, a political or social movement, a sports event, a community effort, or a personal goal. None of these interpretations imply implicit hate speech."
7326,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on criticizing U.S. foreign policy and resource allocation, rather than promoting prejudice against any protected category. While it does defend Bashar al-Assad and could be seen as provocative, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected group. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
6873,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text makes a derogatory assumption about Jewish people, suggesting that they manipulate their racial identity for personal gain. This generalization aligns with stereotypical thinking and uses coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."
2332,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text highlights the founder's speech and the upcoming video, which can be seen as a strategy to attract potential new members or supporters who might be interested in the organization's message. Given that Identity Evropa is known for promoting white nationalist ideologies, the text can be interpreted as implicitly promoting prejudice and recruiting for a hate group."
14563,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly endorses the idea that white males should not feel ashamed of their privileged status, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against other groups by reinforcing a sense of superiority. The phrase 'be not ashamed white male' combined with 'telling it like it is' suggests an underlying belief in white male privilege, which can be interpreted as implicit hate speech."
19917,not_hate,0.85,"The text quotes Thomas Sowell, a well-known economist and social theorist, who is known for his critical views on societal issues, including the misuse of the term 'racism.' The metaphor could be interpreted as a critique of how the term 'racism' is often applied too broadly or inappropriately. In this context, the text might be highlighting the overuse of the term, suggesting that it is applied to situations where it may not be warranted."
7213,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to dismiss the concerns of white people being forced from their homes, which can be interpreted as a form of implicit hate speech. The use of a question mark and the incomplete sentence structure suggests a lack of genuine concern, aligning with the definition of implicit hate speech that includes sarcasm and coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
20182,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses the term 'illegal immigrants,' which is often used in a derogatory manner and implies a negative perception of immigrants. The suggestion of 'criminal penalties' further reinforces a punitive and negative attitude towards immigrants, which can be seen as abusive. The overall tone and language choices reflect an underlying bias and negative sentiment towards immigrants, relying on cultural and social knowledge to interpret the subtle implications of the language used."
4220,not_hate,0.85,"The text presents a statistical observation about the nature of violent crimes, highlighting that most violent acts are committed within the same racial or ethnic group. The phrasing suggests a statistical trend rather than a judgment or stereotype. The use of the hashtag '#proximity' can be interpreted as a neutral observation that violence tends to occur within close social or geographical proximity, which often aligns with racial or ethnic groups."
20779,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'if it ain't brown, they'll take it down' suggests that actions are taken based on the color of something, implying a racial or ethnic bias. The phrase 'if it ain't brown' directly references color, and 'brown' is often associated with skin color, particularly in the context of race and ethnicity. 'They'll take it down' implies a negative action or rejection. This fits into the subtype of Stereotypes and Other Implicit Abuse, as it generalizes behavior based on a stereotype and relies on cultural and social knowledge to imply discrimination."
20407,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the derogatory term 'anchor babies' and stereotypes undocumented immigrants as an economic burden. It also calls for deportation, which is a harmful action. The language is coded and indirectly promotes prejudice against a protected category based on national origin and immigration status."
2260,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'happy birthday uncle adolf ! how i wish you were still with us .' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to the historical context of Adolf Hitler and the euphemistic language used. Referring to Hitler as 'uncle adolf' softens the reference to a historically abusive figure, and wishing him a happy birthday and expressing a desire for his presence implies support for his ideologies and actions, which are recognized as harmful and abusive. This interpretation is supported by the historical context and cultural significance of Hitler's name."
17190,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'Orban: Hungary is a refuge for white Europeans' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to suggest that Hungary prioritizes the protection of 'white Europeans' over other groups. This implies an exclusionary policy where non-white individuals are deemed less deserving of refuge, which aligns with the idea of dehumanization and implicit abuse towards non-white individuals."
12584,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'now while out the white population . what happens ?' can be interpreted as a genuine inquiry into the consequences or effects of the absence of the white population. This interpretation suggests a neutral or curious tone rather than a critical one. The text could be part of a larger discussion or analysis on demographic changes and their impacts, which does not fit the criteria for implicit hate speech."
5322,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The phrase 'white hate' is loaded with racial connotations, implying that white people are being unfairly targeted or discriminated against. The statement 'immigration...will be end of west' suggests that immigrants are perceived as a threat to Western societies, contributing to social and racial tensions. These elements, combined with the geopolitical context, suggest that the text is using fear and prejudice to manipulate public opinion and create social divisions."
18376,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'white power accessories' strongly suggests promotion of white supremacist ideologies, stereotyping, and use of coded language to convey racist beliefs. These interpretations align with the key features of implicit hate speech, including abstract references and stereotypes."
3892,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'new black panther leader says he's gonna hunt down and kill white people' contains a direct call for violence against a specific racial group (white people). This aligns with the definition of hate speech, particularly under the categories of 'Incitement' and 'Hateful References.' The mention of a 'new black panther leader' adds a layer of authority and historical context, making the threat more credible. While the text could be interpreted as provocative rhetoric or political statement, the explicit mention of hunting down and killing a specific group makes it a clear case of implicit hate speech."
2339,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that members of the alt-right movement lack empathy and emotional connection, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The phrase 'if you have it within yourself to kill your own child' is shocking and provocative, and the question 'would you have an emotional connection to your race?' is meant to highlight the perceived lack of empathy within the alt-right movement. The hashtag '#altright' directs this provocation towards the alt-right movement, using extreme language to generate a strong emotional response and draw attention to the issue."
6651,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a deep-seated racial tension and resentment. It implies that efforts by different racial groups to maintain their lands and culture are viewed with suspicion and hostility. The phrase 'whites can't win' indicates a sense of defeatism or frustration among white people, while the ellipsis ('...') and the phrase 'you know how this goes' imply a dismissive or prejudiced attitude towards efforts by black people to maintain their lands and culture. The overall tone conveys resentment and prejudice, suggesting a racial tension."
14420,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text contains coded language and symbols that are strongly associated with white supremacist ideology. Terms like 'white resister,' 'totenkopf 1939-1945,' and '#14w' are not overtly abusive but carry implicit meanings that promote prejudice and support harmful ideologies. The combination of these elements suggests a strong association with white supremacist beliefs, making the text implicitly hateful."
5160,not_hate,0.85,"The statement is a humorous critique of Ivanka's public image or perceived incompetence, using exaggeration to make a point. The exaggerated suggestion of assigning her to the home shopping network is meant to be humorous, and the phrase 'for the good of humanity' adds to the humor by implying that her current role is detrimental to society. The statement is not necessarily malicious but rather a playful jab at her public persona."
18643,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes and stereotypes Chinese people as 'social justice warriors' (SJWs) and portrays them negatively in a conflict with 'native charlotteans.' The term 'SJW' is often used derisively, and the hashtags '#altright' and '#culturalmarxism' are associated with far-right ideologies, further implying a derogatory stance. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice."
8501,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses a rhetorical question and an accusation of violence to provoke and incite negative emotions or actions against 'antifa.' This indirectly promotes prejudice by framing 'antifa' as violent, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
6501,not_hate,0.85,The text critiques societal norms that tolerate or protect racist behavior and systemic advantages benefiting white people. It does not use coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice but rather calls for recognition and addressing of these issues openly.
20788,not_hate,0.85,The text expresses frustration or anger towards perceived injustice or wrongdoing without targeting any protected categories. The inclusion of 'the sex and skin color is irrelevant' emphasizes that the frustration is not based on discriminatory grounds but on the actions of the individuals. The phrase 'meet their maker' can be interpreted as a wish for justice or retribution rather than a literal call for death.
13394,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'is there a dunce cap under that hood? would explain the pointy part.' is most consistently interpreted as playful teasing. The question is posed in a light-hearted way, intended to be playful rather than malicious. The comment about the 'pointy part' is a playful jab, meant to be taken in good humor.

While the alt-right is a controversial group, the question itself does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
14006,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against Jewish people. The phrase 'jew conspiracy' is a clear reference to harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories about Jewish people. The statement 'no wonder the anp endorses you' suggests that the endorsement is a result of the person's belief in this conspiracy theory. The phrase 'if you actually look into it ...' implies that there is some hidden truth or evidence supporting the conspiracy theory, which the person should investigate.

17958,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The phrase 'drive a knife into milo' is a violent metaphor suggesting harm towards Milo Yiannopoulos, which can be interpreted as a call for violence. The term 'Lugenpresse' is a derogatory term used by the Nazis to describe the media, implying that the media is lying and untrustworthy. The hashtag '#maga' adds a political context that has been associated with divisive rhetoric. Overall, the text indirectly promotes prejudice and can be classified as implicit hate speech."
17794,implicit_hate,0.75,"The statement 'cops kill more whites than blacks' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to dismiss or downplay concerns about racial bias and police brutality against Black people.

This interpretation aligns with the definitions and guidelines for implicit hate speech."
14032,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text dismisses or belittles the historical suffering of non-white groups by comparing it to the absence of similar experiences among white groups.

9250,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote a revisionist historical narrative that minimizes the contributions of non-white groups, particularly Native Americans. The phrase 'don't like it ? get out .' is exclusionary and aggressive, creating a hostile environment for dissenting opinions.

17684,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily focuses on the historical and cultural context of the swastika symbol before its association with Nazism. It aims to educate readers about the symbol's original positive connotations and the impact of its misappropriation by the Nazi regime.

19156,implicit_hate,0.9,"The phrase 'swine from the gutter' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its dehumanizing nature, classist undertones, and reliance on cultural stereotypes. The term 'swine' dehumanizes the target by comparing them to animals, while 'from the gutter' implies a low social status. This combination of terms creates a derogatory and dehumanizing insult that relies on cultural and social knowledge to convey its abusive intent."
9429,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'great new posts at ! white america awake rally this july 23rd !' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its promotion of a rally that aligns with white supremacist ideologies. The phrase 'white america awake rally' suggests a gathering focused on white supremacist ideologies, and the term 'awake' is often used in contexts of awakening to a particular ideology or cause. The enthusiastic tone and exclamation marks imply a positive promotion of the event, which could be interpreted as promoting harmful ideologies."
12619,not_hate,0.8,"The text 'perfect example as to why should have more followers than people like' can be interpreted as a neutral or positive comparison, highlighting the strengths of one group or individual without disparaging another. The incomplete sentence structure allows for a range of possible completions, many of which do not necessarily involve prejudicial attitudes or coded language. The context of social media presence and the potential for highlighting positive qualities suggest that the text is more likely to be a neutral or positive comparison rather than implicit hate speech."
2643,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'theres only the white side grow up what isn't white duh ! ! !' suggests that only white people can mature, which is a racist stereotype.

This aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
18094,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that the person's views are dependent on the presence of white people, implying racial bias and stereotyping. The phrase 'his views will no longer exist without whites' ties the person's opinions to a white demographic, and the statement 'nothing about is consistent because he cant understand demographics is destiny' reinforces the idea of racial dependency and ignorance of demographic changes. This indirectly promotes prejudice against non-white groups."

The use of the hashtag '#jewish' in conjunction with terms like 'federal,' 'reserve,' 'manipulated,' and 'stolen' implies a connection between Jewish people and financial crimes. The phrase 'how your money is manipulated and stolen' directly accuses an entity (implied to be Jewish) of financial misconduct. The hashtag '#endthefed' reinforces the idea that the Federal Reserve (often associated with Jewish control in conspiracy theories) is the culprit. The inclusion of '#taxes' suggests that the financial manipulation extends to taxation, further implicating Jewish control over financial systems."
9707,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice against Muslim migrants. The specific mention of 'Muslim migrants' as perpetrators of child rape aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse that targets a specific identity group.

8723,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'happy #easter and happy birthday to adolf #hitler' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its coded language and abstract references. The juxtaposition of a religious holiday with a birthday wish for a notorious figure associated with genocide and hatred is inherently offensive and provocative. This combination is likely intended to provoke a strong reaction and can be seen as a form of implicit abuse. The text also carries an implicitly abusive tone due to the subject matter, regardless of the intended interpretation."
14588,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily defending the legitimacy of activism against white supremacy by criticizing the use of the term 'black supremacists' to describe such activism.

2032,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a call for action to register white males due to their disproportionate involvement in mass shootings.

21032,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text generalizes a behavior to a specific group of people, implying that all black rappers wear jewelry, which is a stereotype. Additionally, the phrase 'The chains remind them of where they came from' likens black rappers to slaves, dehumanizing them by associating them with a historical context of oppression and objectification.

The boy's reaction 'That's DUMB!' indicates that he finds this reasoning illogical or unfair, suggesting that even at a young age, he recognizes the absurdity of the stereotype."
456,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily criticizes the neighbor's extreme views on racism, which is a permissible expression of disagreement rather than an implicit promotion of prejudice. The use of 'ultra liberal' and 'unbelievable' suggests disbelief and disagreement with the neighbor's views, rather than promoting hate or prejudice."
18027,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards the alt-right. The mention of 'khakis and polos at all times including the gym and while' suggests a constant state of readiness, which can be interpreted as a subtle threat or preparedness for violence. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes abstract or coded references and stereotypes."
6270,not_hate,0.9,"The text uses sarcasm to criticize those who blame immigrants for the California drought, highlighting the absurdity and unfairness of such claims. The phrase 'these wonderful people' is used ironically, and the overall tone suggests a critique of manipulative tactics rather than promoting prejudice. The text does not use coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice but rather calls out the unfair blaming of immigrants."
11927,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and hashtags that suggest racial superiority and pride, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against non-white people. The use of '#wpww' (which could stand for 'White People Will Win') and '#whitepride' strongly indicates an underlying message of white supremacy, even if the literal meaning appears positive. The context and tone suggest sarcasm and stereotyping, which are key features of implicit hate speech."
13679,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses hyperbole to express a strong negative feeling about Cruz, but it does not target any protected category or use coded language to promote prejudice. The reference to 'creepy' and 'strangers offering candy' is an exaggerated way to convey dislike rather than a literal warning or a stereotype against a protected group."
1369,not_hate,0.9,"The text generalizes the preferences of women, which can be seen as a stereotype. However, it does not contain coded language, abstract references, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The statement is more of a general observation or stereotype rather than implicit hate speech."
8572,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'are you black or white? and i love women by the way!' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The question about race could be seen as genuine curiosity or an attempt to establish common ground, and the statement about loving women could be a positive sentiment or an attempt at a compliment. There is no indication of sarcasm, misinformation, or appeals to racist attitudes."

The interpretations provided focus on political maneuvers and public relations rather than any form of hate speech."
8658,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'diversity means less white' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to convey a prejudicial attitude. The phrase 'less white' suggests a reduction in the number or influence of white people, and by equating diversity with this reduction, the statement implies that diversity is a negative concept. This negative connotation towards diversity can be seen as a form of implicit abuse, specifically a racist sentiment, as it devalues the presence of non-white individuals."
11259,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'god love you sir! and god save the south!' can be interpreted as a polite and respectful expression combined with a patriotic sentiment. The phrase 'god love you sir!' is a common expression of goodwill, and 'god save the south!' can be seen as a regional wish for well-being and prosperity. There are no explicit or implicit references to prejudice, dehumanization, or incitement against any protected categories. The historical context of the American Civil War does not inherently make the statement hateful without additional context that explicitly promotes prejudice."
128,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily discusses Friedrich Hayek's libertarian views and his work 'The Road to Serfdom.' The term 'milquetoast' is used to describe Hayek's approach, which can be interpreted as a neutral descriptor of his moderate style. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The text does not contain any elements that would classify it as implicit hate speech."
9173,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to target a specific group ('crazy white people') and accuses them of being incited to violence ('go and kill people') due to the recipient's rhetoric. The sarcastic and provocative tone, along with the use of derogatory language, suggests an implicit prejudicial attitude. The text does not use overt slurs but conveys a harmful message through indirect means, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."
801,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily critiques the tendency to label opponents of sanctuary cities as racists, expressing frustration and sarcasm about this practice. It does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes to promote prejudice. Instead, it highlights the unfairness and predictability of such labeling, aiming to raise awareness about the issue."
4831,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language ('jihad enablers') to imply that the target group supports extremist ideologies, which is a form of prejudice against a religious group. The phrase 'so filled with hate it oozes out of your' reinforces negative stereotypes about the target group, suggesting they are consumed by hatred. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
7303,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial and political divisiveness. The phrase 'time for whites to man up' suggests a racial divide and a call to action based on race, which can be seen as divisive. The mention of 'leftist lined up to stand with statue vandals' further implies a negative stereotype about a political group. The overall tone and implications require cultural and social knowledge to fully interpret the abusive undertones, aligning with the category 'Other Implicit Abuse.'"
5649,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The use of quotation marks and the phrase 'then you are absolutely correct' can be interpreted as a neutral acknowledgment without any personal opinion or bias.

It does not contain any explicit or implicit abuse, negative connotations, or calls for harmful actions. It is a neutral description of a historical artifact being discovered."
2974,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to mock the racial stereotype that Southern success is tied to slavery, emphasizing the absurdity of such a belief. The sarcastic tone and the phrase 'a slave they've never owned' underscore the ridiculousness of attributing current success to historical slavery, thereby highlighting its offensiveness. This interpretation is consistent with the text's intent to critique and ridicule the stereotype rather than promote prejudice."
2106,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'american is white and christian you meant love.' uses coded language and stereotypes to imply that only white Christians are true Americans. The addition of 'you meant love' could be interpreted as sarcastic or dismissive, reinforcing the exclusionary nature of the statement. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
9948,not_hate,0.95,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The various interpretations (Sarcasm, Rhetorical Question, Irony, Frustration, Clarification Seeking) all suggest that the speaker is questioning or disagreeing with the idea of exploitation in a business context, rather than promoting prejudice."
10262,not_hate,0.95,"The text explicitly rejects white nationalism and encourages white people to distance themselves from this ideology. It does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it promotes unity, education, and a call to action against a harmful ideology."
10796,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice and incite fear. The phrase 'race riots' suggests impending violence, and 'national socialists' is a euphemism for Nazis, a group historically associated with racial hatred and violence. The mention of a planned demonstration implies organized action, which could be harmful. The overall message could be aimed at causing fear and panic among the public and rallying support for an extremist group."
14395,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies that the white race is superior and that standing for what is right is inherently associated with being white. The phrase 'stood for what was right the white race' suggests a direct link between moral correctness and the white race, promoting a biased view and can be seen as a form of implicit abuse by suggesting racial superiority."
20959,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'What do you call a black spider? No daddy long legs' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it relies on a racial stereotype that black children often grow up without a father. This interpretation is supported by the analysis that categorizes the text under 'Jokes' and identifies it as abusive language disguised as humor. Additionally, the text dehumanizes black people by comparing them to animals, specifically spiders, which is a form of dehumanization."
5870,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and historical references to demean and provoke the alt-south movement, which is associated with specific racial and political ideologies. The use of the term 'cuck' and the reference to losing the war again are indirect ways of promoting prejudice and ridicule. The context suggests an intent to insult and demoralize, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."
18802,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'life goal: publicly execute a kkk member' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice and violence against members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The phrase 'publicly execute' is a clear call for harmful action, and the target is a specific hate group known for its history of violence and hate crimes. While the statement could be interpreted as dark humor or an expression of frustration, the explicit mention of a violent act against a specific group aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
14581,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about the composition of 'ar' by attributing specific negative characteristics to its members, which can perpetuate a stereotype about the group. This generalization and stereotyping can be seen as implicit hate speech because it indirectly promotes prejudice against the group by associating them with negative and controversial ideologies."
18965,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'the real terrorists are in the white house' is most consistently interpreted as political criticism rather than implicit hate speech. The term 'terrorists' is used metaphorically to criticize the government's actions, which is a form of harsh political commentary rather than an attack on a protected category. The context and target identification suggest a critique of government policies rather than promoting prejudice against any specific group."
1275,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and hashtags that are commonly associated with far-right rhetoric and anti-immigration sentiment. The phrase 'we are indigenous to europe' implies a superior or exclusive status based on ethnicity or nationality, and the hashtags '#loxism' and '#antiwhites' reinforce stereotypes and generalizations about certain groups, particularly non-white individuals. The overall tone and context suggest a racist and xenophobic sentiment, promoting racial superiority and exclusion."
12902,not_hate,0.95,"The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. It primarily discusses a political party and the concept of a 'false flag' operation, which does not target individuals based on their membership in protected categories."
258,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'a make america white evangelical male event' explicitly mentions 'white,' 'evangelical,' and 'male,' which are specific demographic descriptors. By specifying these descriptors, the text implies that the event is intended for individuals who fit these categories. This exclusionary language can be seen as discriminatory because it marginalizes other groups who do not fit these descriptors. The use of 'make america' suggests a broader ideological goal of shaping the country in a way that aligns with the values and characteristics of white evangelical males."
7036,not_hate,0.9,"The text criticizes discriminatory views related to employment and homophobia, using phrases like 'it's truly sad that you value employment discrimination' and 'how un-american.'

11095,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and an absurd method to identify someone's ethnicity or religion, which implies a generalization and stereotype. This can be seen as a form of implicit abuse, as it promotes prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
4358,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'purging americas white male heroes via' can be interpreted as a call for harmful action against a specific group, namely 'white male heroes.' The term 'purging' is often associated with forceful removal or elimination, and the phrase 'white male heroes' specifies a particular demographic group. Combining these elements suggests an aggressive or harmful action directed towards this group, which aligns with the definition of a call for action that urges harmful actions against a group."
11768,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains implicit abuse through stereotypes and rhetorical questions designed to provoke a reaction by insinuating that the listener's offense is due to their own racist identity. This aligns with the idea that the speaker is trying to bait the listener into a defensive or angry response, which is a form of implicit hate speech."
141,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text compares black people to animals or pets, which is a form of dehumanization and reinforces racial stereotypes. The use of the KKK, a well-known racist organization, further emphasizes the racial context and the intent to dehumanize.

501,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly mentions that only Scandinavian and Irish people are considered 'white,' implying that all other ethnicities are not considered 'white.' This categorization is exclusionary and aligns with the concept of stereotyping, where certain groups are generalized and categorized based on preconceived notions. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
1976,not_hate,0.95,"The text discusses the personal sacrifices and challenges faced due to religious beliefs, particularly in the context of workplace discrimination. While it highlights the speaker's experience and potentially critiques workplace discrimination, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The statement is more about personal testimony and the challenges of standing up for one's beliefs rather than promoting prejudice against any protected category."
19123,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text contains implicit abuse by urging harmful action against sanctuary cities. The phrase 'stop the payments to sanctuary cities now' is a call for action that could be seen as harmful to a specific group. The mention of 'California' and 'today' suggests a current event that has triggered this call for action. The use of 'too' implies that this issue is not isolated to California but is part of a broader concern. The overall tone is urgent and directive, which could be interpreted as implicitly abusive towards sanctuary cities."
9618,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward historical statement about a specific legislative action taken by George Washington. It describes a historical policy that restricted immigration to free white men. There is no generalization, dehumanization, or call for harmful actions against any group. The text is factual and does not contain any implicit abusive language. It could be highlighting a historical instance of discrimination to critique past policies, part of an educational narrative, political commentary, or legal analysis. None of these interpretations suggest implicit hate speech."
18126,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes the feelings of all Black people towards all White people, which is a form of stereotyping and can lead to harmful and divisive sentiments. Additionally, the text is deliberately provocative and intended to stir up negative emotions, suggesting that racial tensions are just below the surface and can easily erupt."
3338,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses inflammatory language and abstract references to incite anger and outrage by suggesting that a prominent academic is advocating for the elimination of a racial group. The mention of a 'jewish harvard professor' adds a layer of complexity, potentially invoking anti-Semitic tropes. The exclamation mark and the call to 'read more' suggest an attempt to provoke a strong emotional response and encourage further engagement with the content."
231,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'der fhrer adolf hitler - rare moments in colour (video)' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to the use of coded language and abstract references that may glorify or admire Adolf Hitler. The term 'der fhrer' is used without critical context, which can be seen as a form of respect or admiration. The lack of explicit condemnation of Hitler's actions and the casual reference to a figure associated with atrocities can be insensitive to victims and offensive to those affected by the Holocaust and World War II."
2840,implicit_hate,0.75,"The phrase 'white man march' followed by 'yes!!!' strongly suggests enthusiasm for an event that could be associated with white supremacy. Given the historical and cultural context of white supremacy, this interpretation aligns with the idea of implicit abuse, as it subtly endorses a harmful ideology."
18623,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against perceived 'anti-white' policies. The phrase 'anti-white racist censorship' is designed to provoke a strong reaction and incite negative sentiment towards Facebook and those perceived as 'anti-white.' This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
7117,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes towards various groups. The term 'neo-nerds' could be a coded reference to 'neo-Nazis,' and the mention of 'blm & anquifa' in a negative context aligns with common racist and anti-leftist sentiments. The phrase 'sissy terrorists' combines a homophobic slur with the concept of terrorism, indicating a derogatory attitude towards both LGBTQ+ individuals and terrorists. The 'rebel flag' reference could be interpreted as a symbol of white supremacy and racism, given its association with the Confederate flag. The statement 'not a white supremacist hate the kkk' could be a disingenuous attempt to distance oneself from overt racism while still expressing racist sentiments."
9633,not_hate,0.95,"The text discusses career transitions, the benefits of union membership, and offers financial advice without any implicit abusive language or negative connotations. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories."
993,not_hate,0.85,"The text is a sincere question seeking to understand how combatting white supremacy could be considered racist.

16326,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'sound like you may be a white supremacists maam ...' uses coded language and sarcasm to convey prejudicial attitudes.

This aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, including abstract references and sarcasm to promote prejudice."
4968,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text asks for donations to the '#altright,' a movement known for promoting discriminatory and abusive views. The phrase 'w / more' suggests a desire for increased support, which can be seen as a call to action to further these ideologies.

12349,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'germany : non-white in one generation | read more : via' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to suggest a negative demographic shift. The phrase 'non-white in one generation' implies that a non-white majority is undesirable, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The brevity and tone of the statement can be interpreted as alarmist, suggesting that this demographic change is problematic.

The overall tone is informative and descriptive, without any implicit abusive language or prejudicial attitudes."
18227,implicit_hate,0.85,"The use of the definite article 'the' before 'Muslim' could imply a generalization about all Muslims, suggesting that the speaker is making a broad, negative statement about an entire group based on the actions of one individual. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
6521,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'you think fb is anti-white?' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to suggest that Facebook is biased against white people. This interpretation implies a negative sentiment or accusation of bias, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech.

3923,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'adf to supreme court : govt isnt neutral if it treats the religious preschoolers worse than other preschoolers' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it critiques government bias and advocates for equal treatment of religious preschoolers, which aligns with advocacy for fairness rather than promoting prejudice."
9281,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against white people. The phrase 'white problem' stereotypes white people as the cause of racial issues, and the hashtag '#chasingdownwhites' suggests a call for action that implies harmful intent. The historical context of the phrase 'final solution' is particularly alarming, as it echoes the Nazi term for the Holocaust, suggesting an extreme and violent approach."
13286,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The use of 'ha ha ha' and the rhetorical question 'why blame modi for the action of cbi raiding one of your officer' can be interpreted as a genuine defense of Modi, suggesting that the speaker believes Modi should not be blamed for the CBI's actions. The statement 'let cbi do its work' reinforces the idea that the CBI should operate independently, without interference from Modi. There is no evidence of implicit hate speech in this context."
18389,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to accuse the recipient of being biased against white people. The phrase 'why are you so anti white?' is a rhetorical question meant to criticize rather than seek information. The statement 'the flyers didn't have anything hateful on them' suggests that the speaker believes the recipient is misinterpreting or misrepresenting the content of the flyers. The phrase 'your intentions are clearly anti white' directly accuses the recipient of having biased intentions. The final statement 'so hateful!' reinforces the accusation and adds an emotional layer, indicating the speaker's strong disapproval. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it uses indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
6549,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'drumpf's white house of cards featuring' primarily uses political criticism and satire to comment on the Trump administration. The use of 'drumpf' as a derogatory nickname and the metaphor 'house of cards' to suggest instability do not target any protected categories based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other characteristics. The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected groups. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
14301,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text promotes an exclusionary form of nationalism that prioritizes Hindu identity over other religious and cultural identities in India. The phrase 'Hindu rashtra' suggests that India should be identified primarily with Hinduism, and the emphasis on 'Hindutva' reinforces the idea that Hindu identity should be central to Indian nationalism. The command to 'maintain status co' implies a desire to preserve the current dominant status quo, which could be interpreted as marginalizing non-Hindu communities. This interpretation aligns with the analysis that the text contains implicit abuse by suggesting that non-Hindus are not fully part of the nation or are a threat to its identity."
4034,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly critiques the 'alt right' label by suggesting that 'identitarianism' is a more viable option. The mention of 'Identity Evropa' as an example reinforces this critique, implying that the 'alt right' label is less acceptable or successful.

2759,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'white house / black market by #prolife #plannedparenthood' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The interpretations provided suggest political commentary, criticism, or satire rather than implicit hate speech. The hashtags '#prolife' and '#plannedparenthood' contextualize the statement within a political and ethical debate rather than targeting individuals or groups based on protected characteristics."
19481,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'illegal aliens,' which is often considered dehumanizing and stigmatizing towards undocumented immigrants. The phrase 'majority filled/overrun' suggests that undocumented immigrants are the primary cause of the overpopulation issue, implying that their presence is problematic. The rhetorical question format and the use of 'kinda backwards' suggest that the situation is unjust or unfair, but the blame is placed on the immigrants rather than the system. This interpretation aligns with the features of implicit hate speech, including coded language and stereotypes."
20128,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to target immigrants and prosecutors, suggesting that their presence and actions are problematic. The phrase 'get illegals out' is a direct call for action against immigrants, implying that their presence is a problem. The phrase 'apparently the prosecutors giving this type of advice need to be fired' suggests that the prosecutors are doing something wrong and should be removed from their positions. The overall tone is aggressive and implies that both immigrants and prosecutors are causing issues that need to be addressed."
16263,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice. The use of 'kkk' is a direct reference to the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist hate group. The command to wear only white clothes and the threat of verbal abuse reinforce a racially charged implication, making it implicit hate speech."
7351,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'what's white corruption? define white corruption' is most consistently interpreted as a genuine inquiry seeking information about the term 'white corruption.' The question format ('what's' and 'define') suggests a straightforward request for information, and there is no explicit or implicit tone indicating sarcasm or criticism. The term 'white corruption' might be unfamiliar to the asker, prompting them to seek clarification. There is no evidence of coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
18275,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text contains a subtle derogatory remark about the person's Jewish identity. The use of 'jew' as a noun rather than 'Jewish' as an adjective can be seen as disrespectful or dehumanizing. The phrase 'she is jew' might be interpreted as a derogatory or disrespectful way to refer to someone's identity, especially if it is meant to convey a negative stereotype or prejudice. The positive descriptors 'perfect articulation' and 'bold' could be sarcastic or ironic, further emphasizing a negative undertone."
15521,not_hate,0.95,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories.

18814,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily critiques elitism and defends the achievements of individuals from humble backgrounds. It does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

4473,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'the white race isn't dead yet and neither is Scotland or England' contains coded language and abstract references that convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'the white race isn't dead yet' suggests a sense of superiority or fear of decline, which could be offensive to many people. The mention of Scotland and England in this context implies a resistance to cultural or demographic changes that threaten their traditional identity. This aligns with the concept of implicit abuse, where the statement carries implicit racial undertones that could be interpreted as abusive or offensive."
3309,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'is he white?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning paths suggest that it is a genuine inquiry, seeking clarification, or asked out of curiosity. There are no clear indications of coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes that would classify it as implicit hate speech.

8339,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily philosophical and rhetorical in nature, aimed at provoking thought and discussion on the moral status of the unborn. It does not target any protected category with abuse or dehumanization. The conditional statement and the question are part of an ethical debate rather than an attempt to promote prejudice."
2050,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a neutral observation of a response to POTUS's tweet, suggesting a possible scenario without any implicit abusive intent. The phrase 'i replied to one of potus's tweets' indicates a neutral action of responding to a tweet. The phrase 'he needs to condemn antifa' is a straightforward suggestion without any abusive language. The phrase 'if he lashes out at the alt right' is a hypothetical scenario without any implicit call for harmful action, merely describing a potential response."
18300,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the term 'white genocide,' which is a known conspiracy theory used by white supremacists to frame non-white immigration as a deliberate attempt to eliminate the white race. This framing dehumanizes and demonizes non-white immigrants, promoting a racial supremacy ideology. The text implicitly promotes prejudice against non-white immigrants without using explicit hate language."
11445,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes and stereotypes 'ethnic whites' and 'Catholics' by suggesting they habitually brag about cultural sophistication, which implies a negative attitude towards these groups. The use of coded language like 'the other nottheast' adds a layer of subtlety to the prejudice, making it implicit hate speech."
20580,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dehumanize and advocate for aggressive actions against people from 'uncivilized countries.' The language suggests forced deportation and justifies harmful actions, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
5801,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses strong language ('very racist,' 'anti-white') that is likely to provoke a reaction and stir controversy. The mention of 'usually led by whites' adds a controversial element, and the open-ended question 'what is happening?' invites a variety of responses, potentially stirring debate. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
755,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily focuses on sharing a historical artifact for educational purposes. The phrase 'the only known recording of adolf hitler's normal speaking voice' and the hashtags '#hitler' and '#normalvoice' are used for categorization and do not imply any bias or promotion of hateful ideologies. The text does not contain any language that promotes, glorifies, or condemns Hitler, maintaining a neutral tone. The hashtag '#swrm' is ambiguous but does not provide clear evidence of hate speech."
21402,implicit_hate,0.9,"The phrase 'Go back to China' is often directed at individuals of Asian descent, regardless of their actual nationality. It carries a derogatory and exclusionary connotation, suggesting that the person should leave and return to their supposed country of origin. This interpretation aligns with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' where the statement is used to imply that someone does not belong. The phrase explicitly calls for the person to perform an action—to leave and go back to China. This interpretation fits under the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action,' where the statement urges a harmful or discriminatory action against a group or individual. The implication is that the person does not belong and should leave, which is inherently discriminatory."
668,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'raw story : how the alt-right turned me into a cuck :' can be interpreted as a critique of the alt-right movement or as satire/irony mocking the alt-right's use of the term 'cuck.' These interpretations suggest that the speaker is highlighting the harmful nature of the alt-right's ideology or using humor to critique it, rather than promoting prejudice. The term 'cuck' is used in a self-deprecating or ironic manner, which does not directly target or dehumanize any protected category."
2701,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to criticize and insult someone's anti-Semitic views, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The sarcastic tone and the juxtaposition of the person's anti-Semitic views with the suggestion that they should speak on a panel about anti-Semitism imply a prejudicial attitude without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
14672,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement are responsible for the vandalism of the Nathan Bedford Forrest monument, which is a symbol of Confederate history and white supremacy. The phrase 'ride again' suggests a call for action or retaliation against the perceived aggressors, which in this context are the Black Lives Matter supporters. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
15042,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'british parliament should confer the title sir on you sir donald trump ! !' can be interpreted in multiple ways, including sarcasm, genuine suggestion, satire, irony, hyperbole, and parody. None of these interpretations directly or indirectly promote prejudice, use coded language, or abstract references to race, religion, or other protected characteristics. The text does not contain any elements that dehumanize, incite fear, or spread fearful stereotypes about any protected category. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
11240,not_hate,0.95,"The text '... and i am also against toxic people in other movements . if you want my' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The speaker is expressing a stance against toxic behavior, which is a general critique and not targeted at any specific protected category. The various interpretations all support the idea that the speaker is either sharing personal values, seeking support, offering advice, critiquing movements, sharing personal experiences, or calling for action against toxic behavior, none of which align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
14359,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'jk lol im full white :)' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning paths suggest that it is not implicit hate speech. The use of 'jk lol' and the smiley face ':)' indicate a playful or sarcastic tone rather than a malicious intent. The phrase 'full white' could be self-deprecating, mocking the concept of racial purity, or a sarcastic response to a previous comment. These interpretations do not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech, which typically involves coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice."
19533,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey a derogatory attitude towards immigrants. The phrase 'heaven forbid we have strict immigration laws like japan send them all here with our open' can be interpreted as expressing fear or disapproval of immigrants, suggesting that strict immigration laws are desirable to keep immigrants out. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes."
16231,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to link the alt-right movement to Nazi ideology, which is a form of dehumanization and incitement. The phrase 'because you think people are stupid' is insulting and provocative, intended to incite a reaction and reinforce negative stereotypes about the supporters of the alt-right movement."
17804,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to imply that Delhi will decline to a state similar to Kolkata, which is perceived as less developed or desirable. This indirectly promotes prejudice against Kolkata and its residents based on cultural stereotypes."
9420,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'because it's just wrong to be afraid of people who are trying to kill you?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations suggest implicit hate speech. The text does not target any protected category with abuse, nor does it use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it highlights the absurdity of criticizing someone for fearing a genuine threat, invites reflection on the appropriateness of fear in dangerous situations, critiques victim-blaming, uses irony to point out the obvious truth, and calls for empathy. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
13603,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'so i'm pretty sure you're making accusations without watching the video' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a criticism of the recipient's ignorance or a request for clarification, which does not target any protected categories or promote prejudicial attitudes."
21196,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dehumanize Black people. The statement 'That implies they are people' suggests that the speaker does not consider Black people to be fully human, which is a form of dehumanization. The use of the term 'negro,' which is outdated and offensive, further supports this interpretation. The speaker's use of sarcasm and potential provocation also contribute to the implicit hate speech."
19812,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests releasing immigrants so they can have multiple children born in the U.S. by the time their deportation hearing occurs. This implies that immigrants are exploiting the system by having children to avoid deportation, framing the action in a way that encourages negative sentiment and potential harm towards the targeted group. The tone and context suggest a derogatory attitude towards immigrants, implying they are manipulating the system. The exaggerated number '5 US-born kids' reinforces the stereotype and negative sentiment."
10017,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily expresses criticism and frustration towards the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the media. While it uses strong language and rhetorical questions, it does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The focus is on the perceived harm caused by the SPLC and the media's role in propagating it, rather than targeting individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics."
9846,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly implies racial or political bias, suggesting that Obama's invitation is problematic because of the identity of the invitees. The hashtag '#wakeupamerica' could be interpreted as a call to recognize racial or political bias, and the phrase 'do u not get it !' suggests that the reader should be aware of an underlying issue related to the identity of the invitees. The overall tone implies that the speaker believes there is a problematic aspect to the invitation that is related to racial or political bias."
3738,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'you mean you didn't want a third bush term ?' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The various interpretations (Sarcasm, Genuine Surprise, Clarification Seeking, Rhetorical Question, Irony, Provocation) do not suggest any form of implicit hate speech.

The most consistent reasoning is that the speaker is expressing resignation or a pessimistic outlook about a recurring event, which is not indicative of implicit hate speech."
11236,not_hate,0.7,"While Interpretation 3 suggests a potential stereotype about the South, the overall context and language do not strongly convey prejudicial attitudes. The text primarily critiques government policies and FDR's legacy rather than targeting a protected category with abuse. The use of 'doled out the money to keep the south in line' can be seen as a critique of political strategy rather than a dehumanizing or hateful reference."
9862,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'oscars : acting nominees all white via' is most consistently interpreted as a critique of the lack of diversity in the Oscar nominations. The phrase 'all white' highlights the racial homogeneity of the nominees, which in the context of modern societal values emphasizing diversity and inclusion, suggests a lack of representation for different racial and ethnic groups. This interpretation does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice, and thus does not qualify as implicit hate speech."
17512,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'your people ? your people killed a woman ! !' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to accuse a specific group of a serious crime, generalizes blame to an entire group, and has a provocative tone intended to incite a reaction. The use of 'your people' suggests a collective identity, and the accusation of killing a woman is a severe allegation that fits the criteria of implicit hate speech."
5539,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'white supremacist society ? where ? whites are the most oppressed group in the us . #noguilt' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The statement 'whites are the most oppressed group in the us' is presented as a factual claim, which is a coded and abstract reference to race. The hashtag '#noguilt' suggests that the speaker feels justified in this belief and does not feel guilty about it, reinforcing a prejudicial attitude. The rhetorical questions 'white supremacist society ? where ?' could be interpreted as a genuine inquiry into the existence of such a society, implying that the speaker believes it does not exist, which is a form of misinformation and stereotyping."
13452,not_hate,0.95,"The text compares two job roles, Lieutenant Governor and a United Nations position, without targeting any specific group or individual based on protected characteristics. The language used does not contain coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The comparison is straightforward and does not dehumanize or incite fear against any group."
16707,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to belittle or ridicule the significance of the Holocaust and the miraculous survival story of a girl from the Auschwitz gas chamber. The phrase 'seriously some of ...' in this context suggests a dismissive attitude towards the gravity of the subject matter, which can be interpreted as implicit hate speech."
3167,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text highlights racial tensions by suggesting that Democrats are contributing to a divisive environment by targeting white people. The phrase 'people that happen to be white' emphasizes the racial aspect, and the word 'demonize' suggests a strong negative sentiment directed towards a racial group. This interpretation fits the criteria for implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
16318,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text specifically targets a demographic group ('middle class black people') and implies a generalization about their vacation preferences. By framing it as a rhetorical question, the text suggests an underlying assumption or stereotype about the group's behavior or preferences, which can be seen as a form of implicit abuse by reinforcing stereotypes."
17273,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to highlight the alt-right's tactics, which include derogatory terms like 'white race-traitors.' This term is implicitly abusive and dehumanizing, targeting individuals based on their perceived racial identity and political stance. The text exposes this implicit abuse, making it explicit for the reader, which aligns with the category of implicit hate speech."
14662,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to target individuals based on their beliefs in a 'white America,' which can be interpreted as a racial ideology. The statement 'your ideology is a lie' devalues the target's beliefs, and the refusal to engage in conversation unless the target denounces their beliefs can be seen as a form of social exclusion and manipulation. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
14497,not_hate,0.9,"The text directly asks for information about joining a demonstration, which is a straightforward and specific inquiry. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The use of 'really' can be interpreted as emphasizing the sincerity of the question rather than conveying sarcasm or skepticism."
14888,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that immigrants from developing countries are a source of problems. The phrase 'import third world problems' implies that people from these regions bring issues to more developed nations. The sarcastic tone and hashtags further emphasize a derogatory attitude towards immigrants.
11720,not_hate,1.0,"The text discusses a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed to investigate the mysterious deaths of nine Indian nuclear scientists. The language used is neutral and focuses on public safety, transparency, accountability, national security, and justice. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The context is purely about seeking an investigation into unexplained deaths, which does not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
2537,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses a common stereotype about absent fathers, which is often associated with minority communities, particularly African American families. By applying this stereotype to 'white families' and 'America in general,' the text could be attempting to draw a parallel or make a point about societal issues in a way that reinforces negative stereotypes. The use of the exclamation mark suggests a strong emotional reaction, possibly outrage or surprise at the perceived similarity, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice indirectly."
17171,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that the Democratic Party's policies are akin to slavery, which is a dehumanizing and prejudicial comparison. The sarcastic tone and the use of the term 'slavery' imply a negative stereotype and promote a prejudiced view without using explicit hate language."
7848,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning path is Interpretation 5: Identity Assertion. The speaker is asserting their identity and challenging anyone who might have a problem with it. This interpretation suggests that the speaker is standing up for their identity and is ready to defend it against any form of opposition. This does not promote prejudice or use coded language to demean a protected category, but rather expresses self-confidence and a refusal to be intimidated by racial prejudice."
20008,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text contains a dehumanizing metaphor comparing Jews to lice, which is a form of dehumanization commonly used in anti-Semitic rhetoric. This comparison is indirect but clearly conveys prejudicial attitudes towards Jews."
14011,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily invites individuals to a workshop aimed at critiquing and addressing cultural norms within white culture that contribute to rape culture.

385,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text promotes anti-Semitic views by associating Jews with communism and implying that they are responsible for negative historical events. The term 'russian jew communists' is a stereotype that has been historically used to demonize Jews. The phrase 'white christian or not' suggests a division between Christians and Jews, implying that Christians should be aware of the supposed negative actions of Jews. The reference to a 'white hollocaust' could be a coded way of suggesting that Jews were not the primary victims of historical atrocities."
3961,not_hate,0.9,The text is most consistently interpreted as a sarcastic critique of a policy that advocates for the removal of contraception for sexually active adults. The use of irony and the mention of negative consequences such as 'more unplanned pregnancies / abortions' and 'not pro-life. sad.' indicate disapproval rather than genuine support.

9334,not_hate,0.85,"The text is intended to raise awareness about the current struggles and persecution faced by Muslims, drawing a parallel to the historical persecution of Jews before the Holocaust to evoke empathy and understanding. The comparison to the Holocaust is a powerful analogy that highlights the severity of the situation. By drawing this parallel, the speaker aims to make people aware of the seriousness of the current situation faced by Muslims. The intention is to evoke empathy and encourage action to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring."
9468,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text equates 'far left white racists' with the KKK and 'black #racists' with BLM, using coded language and stereotypes to imply that these groups are equally racist. The inclusion of '(dem)' adds a political layer, suggesting that racism is prevalent within the Democratic Party. The phrase 'c the patte' could be interpreted as 'see the pattern,' further reinforcing the stereotypes and promoting prejudice."
15234,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text mentions the KKK and a Confederate flag rally, symbols strongly associated with white supremacy and racism.

21098,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses a historical fact related to the Holocaust as a stereotype, implying that all Jewish people might have such tattoos. By using this stereotype in a humorous context, the text trivializes a traumatic historical event, making it derogatory and abusive. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
14781,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implicitly associates the person with negative connotations by suggesting that they would work with ISIS, a group known for crimes and immoral acts.

18667,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that disarming black people would lead to their harm. The use of sarcasm, irony, and provocative statements, along with the context of gun rights debates (#nra), indicates an implicit prejudicial attitude. The statement 'if i wanted black people to die i wouldn't support disarming them' is structured in a way that the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning, implying that disarming them would actually lead to their deaths."
998,not_hate,0.95,"The text critiques the assumption that black people are harmless or 'just like us,' highlighting that such assumptions are prejudiced and lack empirical basis. This critique is directed at positive stereotypes, which can still be harmful because they oversimplify and generalize a diverse group of people. The text emphasizes the multifaceted nature of prejudice, pointing out that even seemingly positive assumptions can be prejudiced and baseless.

14209,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses 'block' as a derogatory slur to refer to African Americans, implying a racial insult and dehumanizing the person by likening them to an object. This interpretation is supported by the cultural context where 'block' is known to be a derogatory slur used against African Americans. The phrase 'half white' suggests a mixed racial identity, with 'block' being used to denote the non-white part, reinforcing the racial slur."
18686,not_hate,0.95,"The text conveys a positive message about treating people equally regardless of race. It suggests that most people do not let racial differences influence how they treat others, emphasizing a sense of unity and equality.

10327,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'cucks' is a derogatory slang term often used to insult someone by comparing them to a cuckold, implying weakness or lack of masculinity. This term is commonly used in alt-right and online trolling communities to demean and belittle others, often targeting individuals based on their perceived masculinity or political affiliation. The context of the text, which mentions Donald Trump, suggests that the insult is directed at him, aligning with its common usage in these communities. Additionally, the use of this term can be seen as in-group signaling, using language that is understood and appreciated by a specific community, reinforcing negative stereotypes and promoting prejudice."

There are no generalizations, stereotypes, or offensive comparisons. The language is neutral and informative, typical of a news report.

15043,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to criticize the absurdity of the statement that white supremacists are 'fine people.' The phrase 'bro put down the crack pipe' is a sarcastic remark suggesting that the person must be under the influence of drugs to make such a statement. The typo 'white supremacist are find people' adds to the absurdity. The overall tone is one of ridicule, using humor to highlight the absurdity of the statement, rather than promoting prejudice."
5918,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to associate Islam with violence, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The rhetorical question format and the phrase 'i just don't get it' can be interpreted as a means to provoke a reaction and insult Muslims by implying that their religious teachings support violence."
6136,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text subtly promotes discrimination and derogatory attitudes towards a specific group ('jihadis'). The term 'jihadis' is often used to refer to extremists, but it can also be a derogatory term applied broadly to Muslims. The statement implies that this group is a threat, justifying the suppression of their rights. This interpretation relies on cultural and social context to understand the discriminatory undertones."
3429,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text portrays Muslims as violent and responsible for criminal acts, reinforcing negative stereotypes. The dismissive attitude towards media reporting practices further stigmatizes Muslims. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
3012,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice and division. The mention of 'nwo' (New World Order) and the minimization of an event with 'only one died' can be interpreted as promoting conspiracy theories that often target specific groups. The political reference to Hillary Clinton's expected win adds a layer of political manipulation, which can be seen as inciting fear and spreading stereotypes."
19641,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dehumanize Muslims by associating them with the term 'monsters,' even though it claims to separate the people from the religion. This subtle language relies on cultural and social knowledge to interpret, making it implicitly abusive."
5627,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text trivializes or mocks the Holocaust and its survivors by associating it with Roman Polanski's controversial actions. The mention of 'holocaust' and 'survivor' in the same context as 'child rapist Polans' suggests a derogatory and dismissive attitude. The juxtaposition of these elements implies a trivialization or mockery of the Holocaust, which is deeply offensive. The text requires cultural and historical knowledge to interpret, indicating that the intended meaning is to provoke or offend by trivializing a significant historical tragedy."
16225,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text expresses a strong anti-Islamic sentiment, blaming Islam for societal problems and advocating for the removal of Muslims. The phrase 'my child cannot pray in public schools' suggests a personal grievance related to religious freedom. The question 'where is the outrage' implies that the author feels there should be more public anger or reaction to this situation. The hashtag '#islamistheproblem' directly blames Islam for the issue, suggesting that Islam is the root cause of the problem. The phrase 'deport islam' is a call for action, implying that Muslims should be deported, which is a hostile and discriminatory stance."
8109,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to accuse the recipient of using tokenism to disguise white supremacist views. The phrase 'put a black face on your lies' suggests manipulation and deception, while 'white supremacists views' indicates harmful and racist ideologies. This indirect language conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language, fitting the criteria for implicit hate speech."
4349,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that George Soros, a Jewish philanthropist, is controlling the Pope, which perpetuates the anti-Semitic stereotype of Jewish people controlling world events.

3209,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly criticizes Antifa by implying that they are the ones causing incidents when they rally. The phrase 'groups like' is vague and could be interpreted as a way to avoid directly naming the groups being criticized. The mention of 'other #antifa groups' could be seen as singling out Antifa for criticism. The statement 'without incident' could imply that incidents have occurred when Antifa is involved, but not when other groups rally. The context and cultural knowledge might suggest that Antifa is often associated with violence or disruption, making the statement a subtle criticism."
4456,not_hate,0.85,"The text is primarily highlighting the diversity within the political right in the United States, emphasizing that not all right-wing ideologies are the same. It distinguishes between mainstream conservatism and more extreme or fringe elements like 'identity politics for white boys' and 'white nationalism.'

This usage can be seen as a form of implicit hate speech, as it indirectly promotes prejudice by dismissing the concerns of a protected category."
17915,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial animosity and division. It portrays 'blacks and browns' as perpetrators of violence against 'whites,' fostering a sense of threat and urgency. The use of emotive language and vivid descriptions of violence, along with the statement 'blacks and browns hate us,' supports the idea that the text is meant to incite fear and animosity, making it implicit hate speech."
5947,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text labels 'fair' as a hate group and associates it with supremacists and eugenics, which are coded references to extremist ideologies.

This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action,' where the statement encourages or suggests a harmful action."
8595,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text expresses a sense of grievance and victimhood among white people, who feel unfairly targeted and vilified by other groups. The phrases 'anti-white' and 'hatred for our whiteness' convey a sense of victimhood and persecution, and the mention of 'whites shedding their guilt' suggests a belief that white people have been unfairly burdened with guilt and are now reclaiming their pride. This interpretation fits with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' where the language is subtle but conveys a negative and hostile attitude towards a specific racial group."
3156,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to dehumanize and portray non-white individuals as violent and dangerous. The phrase 'non-white invader' generalizes and dehumanizes non-white individuals, reinforcing negative stereotypes and inciting fear and hatred. The context and language strongly suggest a prejudicial intent."
21472,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text trivializes the seriousness of sexual assault by comparing false rape accusations to the fable of 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf.'

13137,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and statistical comparisons to imply the inferiority of Jewish people compared to 'young white men.' The phrase 'you Jews are only 2%' is derogatory and relies on cultural and social knowledge to imply inferiority. The comparison to 'high IQ, high agency, creative young white men' further emphasizes the abusive implication by suggesting that Jewish people lack these qualities. The text's structure and wording are crafted to be provocative and offensive."
8385,implicit_hate,0.85,"The use of quotation marks around 'white' and the phrase 'i don't understand' suggest a sarcastic tone, implying that the speaker is mocking the idea that Jews are not considered white.

Instead, it aims to combat prejudice and hate by highlighting historical facts and promoting empathy."
16636,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'how is this ""pro white"" ?' can be interpreted as a genuine inquiry or a request for clarification. The use of quotation marks and the question mark do not inherently convey prejudicial attitudes or coded language. The context does not provide enough evidence to classify it as implicit hate speech. The most consistent reasoning paths are those that suggest a neutral or genuine intent behind the question."
21471,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains implicit abuse by dehumanizing women, likening them to objects or commodities that can be depleted. The phrase 'they will run out of supply' treats women as objects or commodities, which is dehumanizing. The use of 'GF' (girlfriend) in this context implies that women are interchangeable and can be 'acquired' like products. This interpretation aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse known as Dehumanization."

19861,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement perpetuates racial or ethnic stereotypes by associating certain groups with drug trafficking and criminal activity. The phrase 'drug money' is often stereotypically associated with certain ethnic or national groups, and the mention of 'building the wall' suggests a border wall, which is often a contentious issue related to immigration. The combination of these elements implies that the groups associated with drug trafficking (likely immigrants or people from certain countries) could be exploited to fund the wall. This generalization and stereotyping is a form of implicit abuse."
18279,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a conspiracy theory where history is fabricated to discredit Hindus, which can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice.

17776,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'can't wait to take the tunnel in and out of mexico !' can be interpreted as a derogatory comment on undocumented immigration. The term 'tunnel' is often used as a euphemism for illegal border crossings, and the context of Mexico, a country frequently discussed in immigration debates, supports this interpretation. The tone of 'can't wait' could be sarcastic, implying a dismissive or mocking attitude towards the issue."

12286,not_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly targets groups known for their extremist and harmful ideologies, such as the KKK and white nationalists. The phrase 'can't wait' indicates a strong desire for action against these groups, and the suggestion to 'strip...of their citizenship' is a severe consequence, highlighting the speaker's view that these groups deserve serious punishment. The context of a 'dem president' suggests a hope for political leadership that will take strong measures against these groups. While the language is strong and emotive, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it directly addresses the need for action against hate groups."

19139,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates racial or ethnic stereotypes by portraying a specific group as violent and criminal. The terms 'initiation murders' and 'hunted then murdered' suggest that a specific group is being depicted as engaging in criminal behavior. The reference to 'slave codes' implies a racial or ethnic group historically subjected to oppressive laws. The hashtag '#truefacts' reinforces the stereotype, suggesting that the speaker believes this portrayal to be factual.

12264,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly reinforces stereotypes about Muslims and feminists by presenting the claim as unusual or unbelievable. The phrase 'believe it or not' suggests that the claim is out of the ordinary, and the specific mention of a 'white woman' converting to Islam could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes about who typically converts to Islam. The claim that 'Islam is a feminist religion' is presented in a way that implies it is an unusual or unbelievable perspective, subtly perpetuating negative stereotypes about both Muslims and feminists by suggesting that their beliefs are incompatible."
13049,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to mock and deride the concept of safe spaces and the groups mentioned, particularly 'gay white male atheist feminists.'

6167,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote anti-Semitic sentiments. The phrase 'zionist occupied germany' is a derogatory and anti-Semitic reference, implying that Germany is controlled by Jewish people. The term 'national socialists' is a euphemism for Nazis, and the mention of them living in hiding suggests a secretive or underground presence.

The phrase 'we have americans doing that here as well' suggests that the speaker is pointing out similar racist actions or sentiments within the American context.

This aligns with the concept of stereotypes, where negative generalizations about a group are used to justify prejudice."

The phrase 'we can't allow them to pursue their aims unchecked' can be seen as an urging for action against a specific group. The mention of various institutions suggests a widespread presence of this group, which could be seen as a threat. The term 'unchecked' could be interpreted as a call to restrict or control the group's activities, potentially leading to discriminatory actions. The overall tone could be seen as inciting negative sentiment towards the group."

21446,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text dehumanizes and objectifies women by comparing them to wine, an inanimate object, and further degrades certain women by referring to them as 'cheap,' 'big,' and 'ugly,' implying that they are inferior and undesirable. The use of terms like 'cheap,' 'big,' and 'ugly' is dehumanizing, as it assigns negative attributes typically used for objects to human beings.

19554,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'sharia and civilization is incompatible' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes to imply that Muslims, who follow Sharia law, are uncivilized.

3312,not_hate,0.9,"The text uses sarcasm to criticize the prevalence of racist white people on Twitter and the platform's tolerance of such behavior. The phrase 'is this for real?' suggests disbelief and incredulity. 'i had no idea there were so many racist white people until i opened twitter' implies that the speaker is feigning ignorance to highlight the obvious presence of racism. 'unbelievable' reinforces the sarcastic tone, indicating that the speaker finds the situation absurd.

8096,not_hate,0.85,"The text critiques the idea that there is a 'correct' race for a baby to be, implying that any race is acceptable and that racial prejudice is unjustified. The question 'so what race should the baby have been?' challenges the notion that there is an ideal or preferred race.

The overall tone suggests a rejection of racial prejudice and a call for acceptance of all races."
3348,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'jihad' in a negative context, which is often associated with violent extremism. The reference to Muhammad's words in the Hadith (Bukhari 52:256) is presented in a way that suggests a negative connotation. By linking Muhammad's words to the Manchester jihad, the text implicitly blames Muslims for the violence. This interpretation aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse 'Perpetrators,' where Muslims are depicted as responsible for crimes or immoral acts."
6567,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily aims to provoke thought or discussion about the social construct of race. The use of quotation marks around 'race' highlights its social construct nature, and the pseudo-scientific statement challenges common misconceptions.

The double question marks reinforce the sense of disbelief or surprise, implying an implicit bias against Muslims."
16625,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as sarcastic critique, mocking the idea that white people need representation given their historical and social privileges.

The phrase 'suspected white supremacists just like the two of you' is a direct accusation that is reinforced by the sarcastic and provocative tone.

This combination of elements suggests that the text is intended to provoke a reaction and convey prejudicial attitudes indirectly."
4355,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to delegitimize protesters by suggesting they are not genuine but rather paid actors funded by George Soros.

2407,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses a casual and nonchalant tone to reference the horrors of the Holocaust, specifically the Treblinka extermination camp. This trivialization of a highly sensitive and tragic event can be seen as implicitly abusive and disrespectful, potentially promoting prejudice against the Jewish community.

3326,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses sarcasm to reinforce a negative stereotype about Jewish people being overly concerned with money. The phrase 'it's just money - jeeeesh !' suggests a dismissive attitude towards money, and the follow-up 'and i'm jewish ? !' implies a contrast, as if being Jewish should mean the opposite. The statement 'there's more to life than money' reinforces the idea that the speaker is trying to distance themselves from the stereotype that Jewish people are overly focused on money. The use of sarcasm (indicated by 'jeeeesh !' and the exclamation marks) suggests that the speaker is mocking the stereotype, but in doing so, they are actually reinforcing it."

The term 'exploited' carries a negative connotation, and the phrases 'to attack Confederate monuments' and 'to demonize the cofcc' imply that the criticism was excessive and unwarranted. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
183,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that certain groups (implied to be non-white) are benefiting at the expense of white individuals and their nation. The hashtag '#wakeupwhiteman' suggests a divisive and possibly racially charged message, urging white individuals to recognize and act against perceived exploitation. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it promotes prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
13012,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses broad generalizations and sarcastic language to attribute heinous acts to a large group of people based on nationality or cultural background. This can be seen as promoting prejudice through coded language and stereotypes, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
6517,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'you mean obama was from british labor party ?' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The most consistent reasoning paths suggest that the text is either sarcastic, a genuine question, a misunderstanding, a rhetorical question, or a humorous remark. None of these interpretations indicate implicit hate speech."
7334,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'we are tired of your racist ways' is a direct critique of racist behavior and an expression of collective exhaustion. It calls for change and shows solidarity and support for those affected by racism. The statement is a public condemnation and an emotional appeal for recognition of harm caused by racist behavior. It does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it explicitly condemns racist behavior, which aligns with permissible expressions rather than implicit hate speech."
182,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to portray Hillary Clinton as a dangerous and corrupt figure, associating her with terrorism and significant loss of life. The hashtags '#crookedhillary' and '#hillaryisjihad' are emotionally charged and designed to provoke a strong negative reaction, which can incite hatred and animosity towards her. The lack of context or specific details about her alleged responsibility for these deaths suggests a deliberate attempt to mislead and promote prejudice."
11533,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily a sarcastic commentary on the unfulfilled promises made by conservatives regarding overturning Roe v. Wade. It does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The use of hashtags and rhetorical questions suggests political frustration rather than hate speech."
13210,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a direct criticism of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), portraying them as cowards who hide behind hoods, while contrasting them with heroes who wear masks, likely referring to groups like Anonymous. The hashtags #opkkk (Operation KKK) and #anonfamily (Anonymous family) further support the interpretation that the text is opposing the KKK and aligning with Anonymous. The phrase 'cowards wear hoods heroes wear masks' creates a clear contrast between the KKK and groups like Anonymous, implying that the KKK are cowards while Anonymous are heroes."
18900,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text retweets Robert Spencer, known for his critical views on Islamic extremism and support for Israeli policies. The mention of 'Hamas' and 'Abbas' in a critical context, along with the phrase 'a jew for attending peres,' suggests a coded message that could be interpreted as promoting prejudice against Palestinian figures and supporting Israeli actions. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which uses indirect or coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
15160,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses dehumanizing language ('evil spawn of your hate') and blames the subject for broader societal issues ('ur hate is ruining our america'), which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech. The rhetorical question 'is this what you want?' is sarcastic and meant to belittle the subject's choices, further supporting the classification as implicit hate speech."
5352,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'sounds pretty racist to me' is explicitly calling out racism, which is generally seen as a positive action aimed at addressing and preventing harmful behavior. It does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it directly addresses a perceived issue of racism, which aligns with the goal of preventing hate speech rather than promoting it."
5292,not_hate,0.9,"The text appears to be a news headline reporting a significant discovery related to the Auschwitz death camp. The language used is factual and does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The emphasis on 'more members' and 'more possibility of trials' suggests a focus on justice and historical documentation rather than promoting hate."
10833,not_hate,0.85,"While Interpretation 4 suggests a potential for implicit discrimination, the text itself does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The text is more focused on the legal and philosophical debate around religious freedom and compelled speech, rather than promoting prejudice against any protected category."
2288,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily aims to highlight a serious societal issue in South Africa, specifically the prevalence of rape, and to draw attention to the need for addressing this problem. The use of strong language like 'enduring nightmare' is intended to evoke an emotional response and raise awareness rather than to promote prejudice. The hashtag '#crimestats' suggests that the statement is backed by crime statistics, adding credibility to the claim. The overall tone is critical and advocates for change, aiming to inspire action and support for initiatives to combat rape."
14809,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against a protected category (white people). The term 'anti-white dreck' is derogatory and suggests a negative stereotype. The call to boycott is a form of incitement to discriminate against content perceived as anti-white.
20331,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the term 'leaches' to dehumanize a group of people, comparing them to parasitic animals, which is a form of dehumanization.

The interpretations provided suggest neutral, supportive, or informational purposes without any implicit hate speech elements."
13044,implicit_hate,0.85,"The use of quotation marks around 'holocaust' suggests skepticism or denial, and the term 'holocaust debate' implies that the Holocaust is a topic open to debate, which is historically inaccurate and offensive. This aligns with the idea of 'Other Implicit Abuse' by trivializing a well-documented historical event."
19789,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'oh good, a little tb with your coffee?' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses an offensive comparison to demean or insult someone or something by likening them to tuberculosis, a serious and unwelcome disease. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse involving negative comparisons and offensive analogies."
10825,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward news report about a Russian football fan leader being expelled from France for the second time. It uses neutral language and does not contain any derogatory or abusive terms. The language is factual and does not include any emotive or judgmental terms. The text provides only the basic details of the event, without any additional commentary or interpretation. The use of 'probably' indicates a level of uncertainty, which is common in neutral reporting when all facts are not yet confirmed."
13203,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly implies a negative attitude towards the idea of whites becoming a minority, using the discussion about tax cuts as a cover. The phrase 'whites being a permanent minority' is introduced in a way that suggests it is a negative outcome, even though the speaker claims it is a separate issue. The speaker's willingness to discuss demographic changes if the other person insists could be seen as a reluctant acknowledgment of the topic's importance. The final statement could be interpreted as a deflection, shifting the focus back to a less controversial topic."
7935,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'keep it white' can be interpreted as a directive to maintain a certain racial composition, suggesting that only white people should be included or that something should remain exclusively for white people.

1123,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward report of an event where Chief Cochran was fired by a public entity due to his private views. The hashtags '#sotf' and '#firedforfaith' indicate that the firing was related to his religious beliefs.

The neutral tone and factual reporting style do not promote prejudice or discrimination."
3875,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'a tribute to the white race. take a stand for your people #wakeup! #loveyourrace #aryan #arizona #blog' contains coded language and abstract references that promote white supremacist ideology. The phrase 'a tribute to the white race' explicitly praises the white race, and 'take a stand for your people' urges action in support of the white race. The hashtags '#wakeup,' '#loveyourrace,' and '#aryan' are commonly associated with white supremacist rhetoric. The combination of these elements strongly suggests an implicitly abusive and discriminatory message."
16883,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'do muslims believe sharia law supersedes the constitution?' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that Muslims might have conflicting loyalties. This perpetuates negative stereotypes and can be seen as a rhetorical question intended to criticize or insult Muslims. The question is framed in a way that suggests a preconceived notion and can be used to stir up debate or controversy, especially in sensitive political contexts."
19623,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text juxtaposes the achievements of 'white euros' with the perceived failures of 'blacks,' using coded language and stereotypes to imply racial superiority. This indirectly promotes prejudice against a protected category based on race."
4605,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that white South Africans should leave South Africa, which is discriminatory and harmful. The mention of a petition indicates an organized effort to promote this idea, implying that white South Africans are not welcome in South Africa. This call for action is directed towards a specific group based on their race, which is harmful and fits the criteria for implicit hate speech."
8694,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'saying we are white privileged' suggests a dismissive attitude towards discussions of racial privilege, which can be seen as promoting prejudice. The statement 'who you follow shows who you are' implies judgment based on associations, which can reinforce negative stereotypes. The overall tone of the text is critical and judgmental, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
2191,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and gendered insults to demean someone for joining Antifa, which is a protected category based on political affiliation. The term 'cucked' is often used to imply emasculation or submission, and 'Spartan' represents strength and masculinity. The phrase 'defects to Antifa' suggests a loss of masculinity by joining a group perceived negatively, reinforcing the idea of emasculation. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using indirect and coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
2866,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a critique of inconsistent language use, pointing out the mix of Latin and English in the spelling of 'Europa' and 'identity.' The text does not contain any derogatory or harmful language, supporting the idea that it is a critique rather than an insult. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
10989,not_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly mentions 'white supremacy' and 'racist lies,' which are societal issues. The phrase 'there is a cure for that' suggests that these issues can be addressed or solved. The comparison 'way more money sunk into white supremacy than racial equality' suggests a critique of resource allocation, implying that more effort should be directed towards racial equality. This aligns with the subtype of 'Call for Action,' as it suggests that action should be taken to remedy the situation."
6462,not_hate,0.8,"The text 'whites a necessary but not a sufficient condition' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning is that it is a philosophical or logical statement discussing the role of white people in a broader context, without any derogatory intent. It could be part of a larger discussion on the contributions and limitations of different groups, where the focus is on logical analysis rather than derogatory intent."
10501,implicit_hate,0.75,"The use of the hashtag '#altright' is known to be associated with alt-right ideologies, which are often linked to racism, white supremacy, and other forms of bigotry. The inclusion of this hashtag in an otherwise benign context can be interpreted as a subtle indicator of alignment with these ideologies, making it implicit hate speech."
18262,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dismiss concerns about Islamophobia and racism, which can be seen as promoting prejudice indirectly. The phrase 'they are afraid of being labeled white-supremacists nazis racist' is deliberately provocative and aims to incite a reaction, while the hashtag '#islam' and the phrase 'is not a r' (likely 'is not a race') are used to bait discussions about Islam and racism. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect and coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
5973,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and rhetorical questions to accuse Muslims of wanting to kill Jews and to incite hatred against them. The hashtag '#dontbuythelies' encourages readers to reject any information that contradicts this portrayal, thereby inciting prejudice and fear."
16059,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'he strongly align with your white religious institutions as well' can be interpreted as a neutral observation. The phrase 'strongly align' could be seen as a factual statement about the person's beliefs or affiliations, and the term 'white religious institutions' is descriptive rather than derogatory. There is no explicit or implicit negative language or coded references that promote prejudice."
14148,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'cucking for Israel,' which can be interpreted as a racial or ethnic stereotype implying that Mike Huckabee is weak or subservient to a foreign power. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
5435,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses coded language to express discriminatory views against black people and those with mental health issues. The phrase 'disarming black people' can be interpreted as a coded way to suggest that black people are inherently dangerous and need to be controlled. 'Reviving insane asylums' can be seen as a coded way to suggest that people with mental health issues are a threat and need to be isolated. The use of such coded language allows the speaker to express discriminatory views without being overtly explicit.
12242,not_hate,0.9,"The text is an academic analysis of how antiabortion views and antievolutionism are interconnected within a specific cultural and religious context. The use of terms like 'ubiquitous' and 'kulturkampf' suggests an academic or scholarly approach. The text does not contain overtly derogatory language, suggesting it is more of an academic observation than a critique."
760,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text promotes an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews are deliberately changing the demographic makeup of America to reduce the white population. It uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. The term 'traitors' is used to question the loyalty of those who do not oppose these changes, further reinforcing the negative framing."
12033,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and sarcasm to associate a racial group (white) with stupidity, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The phrase 'stay white' followed by 'stay stupid' suggests a direct comparison between being white and being unintelligent, which is a derogatory stereotype. The sarcastic tone and the suggestion of a new slogan reinforce the insult and the mocking attitude."
9360,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text promotes a conspiracy theory suggesting a deliberate plot to eliminate white Americans through demographic changes and interbreeding with non-white ethnic groups, attributed to Jews and/or George Soros. This aligns with common conspiracy theories and uses coded language like 'white genocide,' which is known in racist and conspiracy theory circles. The text relies on cultural and social knowledge to convey a harmful message, fitting the category of implicit abuse."
15039,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily discusses the speaker's political alignment and support for the BJP and its associated organizations, particularly the Sangh Parivar and Narendra Modi. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The language used is neutral and does not convey prejudicial attitudes."
14314,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses stereotypes to generalize about white people and liberalism, attributing divisive behavior to these groups. The mention of 'islam / liberalism' as the cause of division implies a stereotypical view that these ideologies are inherently divisive. The phrase 'divide and conquer' could be seen as a coded message to reinforce the stereotype that certain groups are intentionally causing division."
5966,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'global ? white latinbet extinctions !' is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways, none of which clearly convey prejudicial attitudes or promote hate. The most consistent reasoning is that the text is either an environmental warning, a cryptic message, a political or social commentary, a gaming reference, a typographical error, or an artistic expression. None of these interpretations directly or indirectly promote prejudice against any protected category."
18855,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily criticizes the integrity of certain writers or media outlets, suggesting they are not truthful in their reporting about the BJP. While it does imply a collective effort or bias, it does not target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics. The language used does not contain coded references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category."
17530,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text suggests that there is scientific evidence supporting certain characteristics or attributes that are inherent to the white race. This interpretation aligns with the use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudicial attitudes, which are key features of implicit hate speech."
15462,not_hate,0.95,"The text expresses gratitude towards individuals or groups actively opposing racist organizations and promoting anti-racism efforts. The phrases 'thank you,' 'standing up to racist dangerous organizations,' and 'oppose racism stop hate' all reinforce a message of advocating against racism and hate, without any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
17674,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'savage' to describe the 'jihad against Israel,' which dehumanizes the perpetrators by likening them to animals or uncivilized beings. This is a form of implicit hate speech as it uses coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. The phrase 'jihad against Israel' also carries loaded cultural and political connotations, implying negative stereotypes about a particular group."
11725,not_hate,0.95,"The text explicitly states a neutral and straightforward request for information about the Holocaust debate, which aligns with genuine inquiry, academic research, historical interest, preparation for a debate, clarification on controversial topics, educational purpose, and personal reflection. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
12340,not_hate,0.9,"The most consistent reasoning path is Interpretation 4: Defense. The speaker is strongly denying a negative or false claim made against mid-Tennesseans, which aligns with defending a group rather than promoting prejudice. The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
7396,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses rhetorical questions and stereotypes to criticize and insult the recipient, implying that they are unpatriotic and against core American and Christian values. This aligns with the use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice, which are key features of implicit hate speech."
20947,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text dehumanizes and objectifies the woman by reducing her to a mere object of sexual arousal. The phrase 'But she did' implies that the woman is responsible for the speaker's sexual arousal, which is a form of dehumanization. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
6143,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'leave black people alone' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it advocates for respect, privacy, and autonomy for black people, which aligns with promoting positive values rather than hate. The context and multiple interpretations support the idea of advocating for non-interference and respect, rather than any form of prejudice."
2669,not_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly dismisses racial divisions as the primary conflict and instead focuses on a higher, more abstract conflict between moral forces. This suggests a call to look beyond racial differences and focus on more fundamental moral issues, which does not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
5179,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcastic and euphemistic language to indirectly criticize 'sanctuary cities,' which is often a coded reference to immigration policies and can imply negative stereotypes about immigrants. The sarcastic use of 'thanks' and the context suggest an underlying negative sentiment towards these cities, which can be interpreted as implicit hate speech."
12488,not_hate,0.85,"The text expresses frustration with the overuse of the term 'racist,' which the speaker believes is applied too broadly and without justification. The statement 'if everyone is a racist then no one is a racist' suggests that the term 'racist' is being overused, and the speaker feels that their actions, which they consider to be based on 'facts and evidence,' are being unfairly labeled as racist. The frustration comes from a perceived misapplication of the term, which they believe diminishes its impact. This interpretation does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
20251,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies a bias or discrimination against the individual, possibly based on their immigration status or some perceived wrongdoing. The language is coded and requires contextual understanding to interpret the abusive intent. The mention of deportation implies an immigration context, where the individual and their dependents may be immigrants. The actions suggested (taking money, fining, deporting) are typically associated with legal or social wrongdoings, indicating a perceived transgression. Understanding the social and legal implications of deportation and fines is necessary to fully grasp the abusive intent."
9720,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implicitly abuses and criticizes Indian Muslims, particularly Owaisi, by suggesting they are disloyal to India. The question is rhetorical, meant to insult rather than seek a genuine answer. The context of an Indo-Pak war adds a layer of political and cultural tension, suggesting that Indian Muslims, led by Owaisi, would support Pakistan, which is seen as treasonous. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse where an identity group is depicted as responsible for crimes or immoral acts."
11530,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly implies a bias or stereotype, suggesting that interracial dating is somehow related to or a cause of domestic violence. The juxtaposition of 'white on white domestic violence' with 'interracial dating' could be interpreted as suggesting a causal or correlative relationship between the two. The rhetorical question format can be seen as a way to insinuate a negative stereotype without explicitly stating it. The lack of context or explanation for the mention of interracial dating leaves room for the reader to infer a derogatory or dismissive attitude towards interracial relationships."
10966,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language to suggest a political strategy aimed at undermining protections against anti-Semitism, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The phrase 'trump the hammer' could be a coded reference to Trump's aggressive political tactics, and 'brings down the anti-semitism laws' could be a veiled threat or strategy aimed at a specific political goal. The term 'remember your trump vigor then' could be a call to action for those who understand the coded language, encouraging them to support this strategy."
14807,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to insult a child by associating them with a derogatory ideology. The phrase 'little white nationalist baby huey' is a direct and personal insult that degrades the child based on their appearance, which aligns with implicit hate speech."
20036,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses derogatory and dehumanizing language such as 'illegals' to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is a coded term that conveys prejudicial attitudes. The statement 'you have no rights to our laws' suggests denial of legal protections and the phrase 'such idiotic claims' dismisses any legal claims made by immigrants as foolish. The overall tone is hostile, implying that immigrants are a burden on the legal system. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it uses indirect and coded language to convey prejudice."
2406,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The use of terms like 'earth worship' and 'tyranny' are more aligned with political and media critique rather than hate speech."
19410,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'idiots like this are worse than the orthodox muslims' uses coded language and stereotypes to convey a negative message about two groups. The term 'orthodox muslims' carries cultural and social connotations, often associated with stereotypes and prejudices. By comparing 'idiots like this' to 'orthodox muslims,' the speaker is drawing on these stereotypes to imply that both groups are undesirable. The use of the word 'worse' suggests a hierarchy of negativity, with the first group being perceived as even more undesirable than the second. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
4726,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews having significant financial influence and political power. The phrase 'jewish money flooding presidential campaign' generalizes Jews as having significant financial influence, which is a common stereotype. The joke about having an 'all-jewish cabinet' reinforces this stereotype by suggesting that Jews are associated with financial and political power. The combination of these elements implies a negative connotation, suggesting that Jewish influence is somehow undesirable or problematic."
5547,not_hate,0.85,The text discusses a controversial figure (Rachel Dolezal) and a complex social issue (race as a social construct) without explicitly stating the author's opinion. The use of a rhetorical question and a conditional statement could be seen as a way to provoke thought and discussion rather than to criticize or defend. The lack of explicit judgment or conclusion in the text suggests that the author is presenting the issue for the reader to consider and form their own opinion.
15941,implicit_hate,0.75,"The phrase 'antifa is terrorizing people' directly accuses Antifa of terrorism, which can be seen as promoting a fearful stereotype about a political group. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes without explicit hate language."
3861,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning path is Interpretation 5: Playful Banter. The text uses a light-hearted tone and exaggerated language to engage in friendly teasing rather than conveying prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'if you say so kid' and 'prepare for assimilation' are used humorously, and the '* yawn *' at the end is meant to be humorous rather than dismissive. There is no evidence of coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
15924,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'because y'all think he's white cause he is' can be interpreted as a straightforward statement of fact or a defense against misperception. It does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The context suggests a clarification of racial identity rather than any form of hate speech."
1754,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to accuse specific individuals of being associated with white nationalist hate groups. This indirectly promotes prejudice against these individuals based on their perceived affiliations, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
8765,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'frauds' is used to describe a group, which is a direct insult and generalizes a belief about the group being inherently dishonest or deceitful. The comparison between 'amren' and 'rebel' further supports the stereotype by suggesting that 'amren' is less credible or influential. This aligns with the use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
15593,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'when that mandate erasure then makes insurance too expensive people will have' discusses the economic impact of removing a mandate on insurance costs. It does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The text is purely focused on policy and financial implications without any implicit hate speech elements."
2420,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'losers looking for scapegoats to blame do . successful people less so . fact .' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The text critiques a general behavior of blaming others for failures, which is a common motivational or social commentary rather than implicit hate speech."
16087,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudicial attitudes. The term 'race realist' is often a euphemism for racist ideologies, and the claims about the superiorities of different races reinforce harmful stereotypes. The contradiction between claiming no race is superior and then assigning superiorities to different races indicates an implicitly abusive message."
7373,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'white man invades mosque' uses coded language and abstract references to race and religion, suggesting an unwelcome or threatening presence. The term 'invades' implies hostility, and the juxtaposition of 'white man' and 'mosque' can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against Muslims and racial tension. This interpretation is consistent with the definition of implicit hate speech."
17666,not_hate,0.95,"The text ': ministries can keep feeding homeless : #standforrfra #rfra' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The hashtags #standforrfra and #rfra refer to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is about protecting religious freedom rather than promoting prejudice. The statement about ministries feeding the homeless is a positive message about charitable work. There is no implicit or explicit hate speech in the text."
10390,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references to racial and intellectual superiority, which are used to belittle and insult the recipient. The phrase 'i'm a very white guy' suggests a strong identification with whiteness, which can imply a sense of superiority. The claim 'a scholar of nordic things' and 'i can read the elder edda' emphasizes the speaker's knowledge of ancient Nordic texts, which are often associated with cultural and intellectual superiority. The direct statement 'i hate you' adds a layer of explicit hostility, confirming the abusive intent. The phrase 'maybe think about that for a minute' suggests the speaker wants the recipient to reflect on their inferiority compared to the speaker's perceived superiority."
19758,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to imply that a group of people, likely immigrants or refugees, are a burden on society and dependent on government funds. This aligns with common prejudicial attitudes and stereotypes, making it implicit hate speech."
3776,implicit_hate,0.75,"The phrase 'white genocide' is a known dog whistle used by white supremacists to express fear of diversity and multiculturalism. The speaker's identification as white adds a layer of irony, suggesting that they are mocking the idea that diversity is a threat. However, the use of such a phrase, even sarcastically, can still be interpreted as promoting prejudice through coded language."
6438,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice against Jews and white people. The phrase 'jew-controlled media' is a well-known anti-Semitic trope, and 'white genocide' is a term often used by white supremacist groups to spread fear and promote their ideology. The text implies that Jews are responsible for controlling the media and remaining silent about the alleged 'white genocide,' depicting them as perpetrators."
12355,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'good 1 . white people are toast with childish self prescrided spokesment like u at the helm .' contains coded language and abstract references that convey prejudicial attitudes towards white people. The phrase 'white people are toast' is a derogatory comparison, and 'childish self prescrided spokesment' is a derogatory reference to someone who is self-appointed and unqualified. The text implies that white people are facing a negative outcome due to the actions of an incompetent leader, which can be seen as a racial commentary promoting prejudice."
7141,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards liberals, portraying them as irrational and hypocritical. The use of the term 'crazy' and the juxtaposition of statements imply a perceived inconsistency in liberal views on racism, which can be seen as a form of implicit hate speech."
19376,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes a group and stereotypes their reproductive behaviors, implying a homogeneous characteristic or behavior. This can be seen as a form of implicit abuse by stereotyping different groups based on perceived population dynamics."
19502,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to dehumanize and mock individuals living in primitive conditions, suggesting they are uneducated and unsophisticated. The phrase 'lives in a mud hut' and 'no background' are used to describe someone in a primitive or inferior condition, and the use of 'lmao' adds a dismissive and mocking tone. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
8901,not_hate,0.85,"The text is a straightforward report of public opinion regarding border controls during a refugee crisis. It does not explicitly endorse or criticize the border controls or the refugees. The language is neutral and does not contain any derogatory or inflammatory terms.

5433,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward, neutral report of an event where thousands of Russian nationalists have gathered in the capital. There are no derogatory, stereotypical, or harmful terms used. The phrase 'thousands of Russian nationalists' is descriptive and does not carry any negative connotations. The phrase 'have rallied in Russia's capital' is a neutral statement of an occurrence. The 'read more :' suggests a continuation of the report, indicating further neutral information might be available."
13463,not_hate,0.85,"The text aims to clarify the unique identity of mestizos, distinguishing them from other ethnic and cultural groups. It emphasizes the mixed heritage of mestizos, which is distinct from purely white, Hispanic, or Spanish identities. The text highlights their unique cultural identity, which is a blend of European and indigenous influences, and is meant to educate readers about the specific ethnic and cultural identity of mestizos, rather than to exclude or derogate them."
3532,not_hate,0.9,"The text criticizes conservatives for their perceived contempt towards the poor, particularly poor whites. It uses strong language ('disgusting') to condemn this attitude, which is a form of political commentary and advocacy for the poor rather than promoting prejudice or hate. The text does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes to promote prejudice against any protected category."
20465,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text associates immigrants or refugees with ISIS soldiers, instilling fear and suspicion. It blames liberals for this perceived threat, using derogatory language ('bleeding libs') and suggesting that vigilance is necessary due to the danger posed by immigrants or refugees. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice."
3638,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'what's the deal / is it wrong now to be superior and white ?' can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or defend the idea of racial superiority. The phrase 'superior and white' reflects a belief in racial superiority, and the question format ('is it wrong now') challenges perceived criticism of this belief. The word 'now' suggests a defensive stance against recent societal shifts, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
17317,not_hate,1.0,"The text 'the realist report mike king' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. All provided interpretations are neutral and straightforward, referring to various forms of media or documents without any implicit hate speech elements."
16541,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'white sharia' is known to be used by far-right and white supremacist groups, advocating for a society where white men dominate and control women and minorities, often through violent means. The use of the question mark could be a rhetorical device to soften the statement while still endorsing the ideology. The context in which the phrase is used could imply agreement or support for this abusive ideology."
17143,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that demean white women, suggesting they are inferior compared to women of other races. The language used is derogatory and implies a negative comparison, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."

It does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The content is purely political and does not target individuals or groups based on their membership in protected categories."
7654,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'and you're what we call a white supremacy sympathizer' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The phrase 'white supremacy sympathizer' is a highly charged label that indirectly conveys prejudicial attitudes towards individuals based on their perceived support for white supremacy. The use of 'what we call' suggests a broader categorization, which can be seen as a form of dehumanization or stereotyping. The context and tone of the conversation are crucial in determining the intent, but the accusation itself is inflammatory and likely to provoke a strong reaction, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
13014,implicit_hate,0.75,"The use of quotation marks around 'holocaust survivor' could be interpreted as casting doubt on the legitimacy of the person's status. This could be seen as a subtle way to question or belittle the person's experience, which is a form of implicit abuse. The text requires cultural and contextual knowledge to interpret the potential abusive implication, fitting the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse.'"
12250,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it critiques a perceived bias towards protecting only white heritage, which aligns more with calling for awareness and inclusivity rather than promoting hate."
2786,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the media and government, suggesting they are spreading misinformation or fear-mongering. While it expresses distrust, it does not target any protected category with abuse or promote prejudice. The use of 'spooks' and 'fictional' does not directly or indirectly reference any protected characteristics."
19273,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses highly derogatory and dehumanizing language ('a bunch of aids-ridden cannibals living in mud huts') to describe a group of people, implying their inferiority. The speaker finds it amusing that someone with a small percentage of their genetics from this dehumanized group thinks they can talk down to them, suggesting a sense of racial superiority and mockery. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
17025,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses rhetorical questions and stereotypes to imply unfair treatment of white men, which can be seen as promoting prejudice through coded language and abstract references. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
3881,not_hate,0.95,"The text is concise and factual, naming two individuals and specifying their action (responding to an event). There is no additional context or language that suggests any bias, emotion, or opinion. The absence of derogatory language, stereotypes, or harmful calls to action supports the neutrality of the statement."
11433,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'do black people work in fields in central Alabama?' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it reinforces a stereotype about black people working in fields, which is historically associated with slavery and manual labor. The phrasing could be interpreted as implying that black people are still predominantly engaged in manual labor, reinforcing a stereotype. The question does not provide context that suggests it is seeking genuine information, which could imply a stereotypical assumption."
20403,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily expresses strong opposition to a political decision regarding DACA recipients and urges action against it. While it conveys frustration and a call to action, it does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The focus is on a political stance rather than targeting individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics."
5384,not_hate,0.95,"The text critiques the Family Research Council for making an unfounded and harmful connection between Dan Savage and a racist fraternity chant. The use of 'hate group' to describe the FRC and 'inexplicably' to describe the link suggests a critical and defensive tone rather than promoting prejudice. The hashtag '#lgbt' indicates support for the LGBTQ+ community. The overall message is one of support and critique, not implicit hate."
6416,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that white people are inherently more intelligent than other racial groups by implying that IQ is a more accurate measure of worth or success. This interpretation aligns with historical and pseudoscientific claims about racial differences in IQ, which can be seen as promoting racial superiority and dehumanizing other racial groups."
5714,not_hate,0.95,"The statement from the White House spokesman calling to 'redouble efforts to explain the true tenets of Islam' is most consistently interpreted as a call for increased education and understanding, addressing misconceptions, promoting religious tolerance, or a political strategy to improve relations. None of these interpretations involve coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The statement aims to foster understanding and bridge gaps in knowledge, which aligns with positive and constructive intentions rather than implicit hate speech."
14870,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text critiques the inherent racism and violence in the ideologies of 'La Raza.' The initial goal of 'improving the race' to European standards is seen as derogatory and racist, and the shift to 'kill whitey!!' is viewed as an equally problematic and violent response. The use of the word 'insane' underscores the irrationality and extremism of these ideologies. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes."
4853,not_hate,0.9,"The text uses sarcasm to mock the idea that white people could not understand the concept of white privilege because the term did not exist in the past. This interpretation does not promote prejudice but rather critiques the lack of understanding and awareness. The sarcastic tone is used to highlight the absurdity of the idea that understanding is dependent on the existence of a specific term, which does not align with the features of implicit hate speech."
17182,not_hate,0.95,"The text expresses genuine concern about the current situation and questions why a platform or authority is allowing white nationalists to promote hate. The phrase 'on the eve of what is a very scary time for many of us' suggests a sense of impending danger or fear, indicating genuine concern. The question 'why are you allowing white nationalist to promote hate?' directly addresses an authority or platform, implying a desire for accountability and change. The text does not use abusive language or stereotypes, supporting the idea that it is a genuine question rather than a disguised insult."
13073,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. While Interpretation 4 suggests manipulative control, it does not target any specific group based on protected characteristics. The text is more about personal criticism or manipulation rather than hate speech."
401,not_hate,0.85,"The text is simply observing the changes in CPAC over a year without any judgment. The phrase 'come a long way' can be taken literally to mean that CPAC has undergone significant changes. The mention of specific events (an anti-Trump walkout and a Milo keynote) is merely descriptive, not evaluative. The text does not explicitly state whether these changes are positive or negative, leaving room for a neutral interpretation."
12677,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly implies a negative stance towards unaccompanied minors and immigration, particularly through the use of the hashtag '#noamnesty.' This hashtag suggests opposition to granting amnesty to unaccompanied minors, which can be seen as a dismissive or hostile attitude towards a vulnerable group. The phrase 'six facts you should know but probably don't' could be interpreted as implying that the audience is ignorant about the issue, which might be seen as condescending. The combination of these elements can be interpreted as a subtle form of implicit abuse, as it suggests a negative stance towards a specific group without using explicit abusive language."
7655,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses emotionally charged language ('anti-white racist attacks') and links it to a specific political administration ('Obama's America'), which can be seen as a deliberate attempt to stir controversy and blame. This coded language and abstract reference to racial tensions suggest an intent to provoke and inflame racial divisions, aligning with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
13926,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly states that Trump is promoting white nationalism, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The phrase 'Paris is no longer Paris' is interpreted as a coded message that aligns with white nationalist views, implying negative transformation due to immigration or other changes. This coded language and the overall message promote prejudice against protected categories, specifically targeting immigrants and non-white individuals."
19646,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'parasites' to dehumanize a group of people, implying they are leeching off others. The second sentence reinforces the idea that these people are not genuine refugees, further dehumanizing them. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
44,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'german govt . forbade police to name north' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language ('North') that could refer to a specific ethnic, religious, or national group.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes."
10321,not_hate,0.95,"The text discusses a historical event related to the Holocaust and the release of previously unpublished papers by Israel. It does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The mention of 'Holocaust' and 'Eichmann papers' is factual and informative, typical of news headlines or academic references."
17018,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily expresses frustration with single-issue voters who prioritize the wall policy over broader considerations. While the wall policy is controversial and often associated with anti-immigrant sentiments, the text does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The speaker's focus is on the political motivations of Trump supporters rather than dehumanizing or inciting hatred against any protected category."
17699,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'actually white people do commit crime' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of these interpretations suggest implicit hate speech. The statement is either a straightforward correction of a misconception, sarcastic, defensive, educational, ironic, or a form of social commentary. None of these interpretations use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, they aim to address biases, educate, or critique societal norms without promoting prejudice."
12439,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'if you're a white American you know .' can be interpreted as a critique of ignorance, suggesting that white Americans may be unaware of certain issues or perspectives. This interpretation does not promote prejudice but rather encourages self-reflection and awareness. The incomplete nature of the sentence allows for various interpretations, but none of them directly or indirectly promote hate or prejudice."
4858,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish people, specifically that they are financially motivated, even in morbid contexts such as death. This generalization and stereotyping demean a group of people, and the context of death adds a layer of insensitivity and disrespect, making the stereotype even more harmful."
15284,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'white genoci,' which is a misspelled version of 'white genocide,' a known conspiracy theory that suggests there is a deliberate effort to harm or eliminate white people. This term is often used to promote racist and xenophobic views. The mention of globalization in this context implies that the author views globalization as a threat to white people, and by naming Paul Ryan, the text suggests that he is complicit in this alleged conspiracy. The phrase 'linking the cops to the rally is lame' could be a dismissive comment about attempts to connect law enforcement to the conspiracy, suggesting that the author believes such connections are not credible. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudicial attitudes."
638,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against non-white people or immigrants. The term 'white genocide' is a common trope in racist and xenophobic discourse, implying that the presence of non-white people is a threat to the white population. The phrase 'now they are calling for an invasion' reinforces this sentiment by framing immigration or the presence of non-white people as an invasion."
6078,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses rhetorical questions and generalizations to imply that pro-white individuals are unfairly labeled as racist. This aligns with the use of coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudicial attitudes without using explicit hate language.
3606,not_hate,0.9,"The text provides factual information about a tragic event without using coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The mention of 'Islamic State jihad' is a factual attribution to a known terrorist organization, and the hashtag '#tcot' suggests sharing within a specific community for awareness or discussion. There is no language that generalizes, depicts a group as perpetrators, makes negative comparisons, dehumanizes, uses euphemistic constructions, or calls for harmful actions."
8288,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about white nationalists by suggesting that their money comes from specific sources like Louisiana cotton fields, which reinforces a stereotype about the financial backing of white nationalists. This use of stereotypes to criticize and insult white nationalists falls under implicit abuse."
16392,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes. The term 'plagiarist' and the hashtag '#ignorantazzwipefareed' are coded references that require knowledge of Fareed Zakaria and his controversies. The statement about Trump supporters being white plays on existing stereotypes and cultural narratives, which can be seen as promoting prejudice indirectly."
3660,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'haji terrorist,' which is a coded reference to Muslims and conveys prejudicial attitudes. The mention of an investigation for hate suggests a societal response to racist or Islamophobic behavior, highlighting the issue of racism and the need for accountability.

The language is positive and lacks any references to protected categories or prejudicial attitudes."
15274,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text advocates for the exclusion of immigrants or foreign workers from job opportunities in favor of American citizens. The phrase 'just don't allow any in' suggests a barrier to entry for a certain group, and the term 'our american people' implies a distinction between Americans and non-Americans. The call to 'start hiring our american people to do the jobs' suggests that jobs should be reserved for Americans, excluding others. This interpretation aligns with xenophobic sentiments, where foreigners are seen as a threat to local job opportunities."
2847,not_hate,0.9,"The statement 'you're a racist!' is a direct accusation and does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is an explicit accusation rather than implicit hate speech."
14707,implicit_hate,0.85,The phrase 'white guilt' is often used to dismiss or belittle genuine concerns about racial inequality and social justice. The term 'cringe compilation' suggests that the content is meant to be embarrassing or laughable. Combining these elements implies that the compilation is intended to ridicule individuals who acknowledge and express remorse for systemic racial issues. This interpretation requires cultural and social knowledge to understand the implicit abuse directed towards those who express 'white guilt.'
18516,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against Muslims. The mention of Ayatollah Khomeini in a highly offensive context, combined with the hashtag '#islamophobia,' suggests an intent to spread anti-Muslim sentiment. The extreme and abusive language, including the mention of sexual assault against a child, is designed to evoke strong negative emotions and reinforce anti-Muslim stereotypes."
18676,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'even the white nationalist movement is ran by jews' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes to promote an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The statement suggests that Jews are secretly controlling a movement that is ostensibly against them, aligning with historical anti-Semitic tropes that portray Jews as manipulative and controlling. This interpretation is supported by the context of white nationalism, which is typically associated with anti-Semitic ideologies."
17094,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The mention of Donald Trump and the prediction about economic growth are presented in a light-hearted and humorous manner, with the final comment 'it is silly though' serving as a punchline.

6318,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text perpetuates racial stereotypes and dehumanizes a specific racial group (blacks) by portraying them as inherently violent and power-hungry. It uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice, such as describing a scenario where 'whites are being brutally massacred by blacks' and referring to a 'race war.' The use of the term 'genocide' implies a systematic and intentional act of violence, which is a severe accusation that dehumanizes the group."
7290,not_hate,0.85,"The text can be interpreted as sarcastic, ironic, or a straightforward expression of self-aggrandizement. These interpretations do not target any protected categories or promote prejudice. The statement is more about the speaker's perceived superiority rather than degrading any specific group based on protected characteristics."
4027,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to critique individuals who identify as a different race than their perceived appearance, suggesting that they are exploiting cultural identities for personal gain. The reference to Rachel Dolezal reinforces this idea by highlighting a specific example of someone who was perceived to be exploiting a different racial identity. This can be seen as promoting prejudice against individuals who identify with a different racial identity than their perceived appearance."
7985,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily critiques the mainstream media and does not target any protected categories with abuse or prejudice. It acknowledges Milo's controversial nature but does not use coded language, stereotypes, or indirect ways to promote prejudice against any protected group. The comparison is more about public opinion and frustration with the media rather than promoting hate."
7068,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language to convey a subtle message that requires cultural and social knowledge to interpret fully. The phrase 'liberals have caused the greatest backfire' could be a coded reference to specific political events or policies that have had negative consequences. The statement 'white supremacists are tools' could be a coded way of saying that white supremacists are being manipulated by more powerful entities. The well-wishing statement 'i hope you and your child good health' is a neutral or positive remark, possibly intended to soften the impact of the previous statements."
13192,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and coded language to critique the perceived bias in how hate crimes are reported or handled, suggesting that hate crimes against white people are not taken seriously. This indirectly promotes prejudice by implying that certain groups are not considered victims of hate crimes, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
14978,not_hate,0.95,"The text explicitly states a desire for religious freedom without any hidden insults, sarcasm, or rhetorical questions. It does not rely on cultural, social, or contextual knowledge to imply any form of abuse and focuses solely on the family's personal and business practices."
17822,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'drephther a blakkka skin head on da west kost sampl fred wesley' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly indicate implicit hate speech. The most consistent reasoning is that the text is likely a phonetic transcription referring to a musical sample or a description of a person in a musical context, which does not contain coded language or abstract references promoting prejudice."
5949,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily focuses on allegations of financial misconduct and corruption within a political party. It does not target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics such as race, religion, or ethnicity. The language used is not coded or abstract in a way that promotes prejudice against any protected category. Instead, it discusses specific actions that are generally considered unethical or illegal, but not hateful."
1048,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'jihad murderer,' which is a derogatory label that implicitly associates Muslims with violence. The sarcastic tone and the contextual clues provided by the hashtag '#tcot' suggest that the text is aimed at a conservative audience, critiquing the hypocrisy and absurdity of such labels. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
18460,not_hate,0.9,"The text is critiquing the idea that being 'pro-white' implies a belief in racial superiority. It acknowledges that cultural pride is acceptable but suggests that identifying as 'pro-white' and thinking one is better is not acceptable. The term 'pro-white' is often associated with white supremacist ideologies, which are inherently abusive and discriminatory. Therefore, the text is likely critiquing the notion of racial superiority associated with being 'pro-white.'"
18163,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the person's ideological bias and questions their credibility as a historian, but it does not target any protected categories or use coded language to promote prejudice.

21387,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'You are not really a man if you haven't seen them' explicitly ties the listener's masculinity to their familiarity with the movies, reinforcing traditional gender roles and expectations. This interpretation highlights the speaker's belief in traditional gender roles and expectations, using the movies as a benchmark for masculinity, which can be seen as promoting prejudice through stereotypes."
9342,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes and stereotypes a group of people as uniformly opposing the concept of 'white nations,' which can be seen as a form of implicit abuse. The use of 'they all' suggests that the author is attributing a uniform belief to a diverse group, likely referring to non-white people or advocates for diversity. This interpretation falls under the subtype of 'Stereotypes' in implicit abusive language."
12963,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a standard critique of a public figure's actions and values, common in political discourse. The terms 'unfit for office' and 'extremist values' are typical of political rhetoric used to discredit opponents. The comparison to other politicians is a common tactic in political discourse to highlight similarities or differences.

19416,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text dehumanizes the individual by suggesting they are less than fully human and mentally deficient, reinforced through sarcastic language. This indirectly promotes prejudice against the individual based on their perceived religious affiliation."
19774,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'correct, they're not. so why are they here? get rid!' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The phrase 'get rid!' is a direct call for action, suggesting harmful measures against a group of people. The context implies criticism and a desire for their removal, which aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action.' The question 'so why are they here?' reinforces the speaker's negative sentiment and desire for their removal, making it a rhetorical question used to criticize or insult. The overall tone and intent of the text promote prejudice and hostility towards a group of people."
19852,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and cultural references to convey an abusive message. The reference to '72 virgin devils' is a twisted allusion to the Islamic belief in 72 virgins awaiting martyrs in paradise, which is used here to insult and demean someone, likely implying they are destined for eternal torment.

17455,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against white men and white women. The phrase 'why do you want to exploit the race you claim to love?' is a coded reference to racial dynamics, and 'white men shouldn't exploit white women' reinforces a stereotype. The concluding phrase 'shame on you' serves as a direct insult, aiming to shame the individual, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."

The purpose is to inform potential listeners about the content of the podcast. While the term 'alt-right' is often associated with far-right ideologies, the text itself does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
580,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'make america white again : saturdays nationalist unity gathering | traditionalist youth network' uses coded language and abstract references to promote a white-only society, which is inherently racist and exclusionary. The context of a 'nationalist unity gathering' and the 'traditionalist youth network' suggests alignment with white supremacist ideologies, which are known for their discriminatory and abusive nature towards non-white groups."
17129,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text generalizes Muslims in India as a homogeneous group that teaches children to hate and kill non-Muslims, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inciting fear and mistrust. This aligns with the definitions of implicit hate speech through stereotypes, misinformation, and incitement."
3122,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not target any specific protected category or use coded language to promote prejudice. Instead, it critiques the perceived ideological conformity and lack of independent thought in New York City. The term 'correctthink' is used sarcastically to highlight this conformity, and the mention of 'sane people' being rare implies that independent thinkers are marginalized. There are no references to violence, incitement, slurs, dehumanization, or hateful imagery."
3434,not_hate,0.85,"The text is criticizing Bill O'Reilly for perpetuating harmful racial stereotypes about Black people. The phrase 'plays to white stereotypes of blacks' suggests that O'Reilly is intentionally or unintentionally reinforcing negative stereotypes about Black people. The term 'white stereotypes of blacks' implies that these stereotypes are held by white people and are being used by O'Reilly. The context of 'the occidental observer' suggests a critical or analytical perspective, which aligns with the idea of calling out O'Reilly's behavior."
7583,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reflects the speaker's personal biases and prejudices against the people of Alabama. The use of derogatory terms like 'backwoods rednecks' and the extreme claim that 'they want to kill gays and blacks' suggest a deep-seated prejudice. This language is coded and indirect, promoting prejudice without using overt slurs."
10240,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and relies on cultural and social context to convey an abusive message, dismissing the concept of white privilege and undermining legitimate discussions about systemic racial issues. The phrase 'the entire concept is to make white people feel bad that we are white' suggests that the speaker believes the primary purpose of discussing white privilege is to make white people feel guilty. The comparison to 'original sin for whites' implies that the speaker views the concept as a form of inherent guilt assigned to white people, akin to the religious concept of original sin."
17000,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'i don't know i kind of like black people.' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The most consistent interpretations suggest genuine uncertainty, cautious positivity, or ambivalence, none of which indicate implicit hate speech."
5775,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses hashtags that are commonly associated with racist and anti-Semitic views. The hashtag '#wpww' (White People Wake Up) is often used in racist and white supremacist contexts. The hashtag '#zog' (Zionist Occupied Government) is a term used by anti-Semitic groups to suggest that governments are controlled by Jewish people. The hashtag '#nwo' (New World Order) is a conspiracy theory that often implies a global elite is manipulating world events, sometimes with anti-Semitic undertones. The combination of these hashtags suggests that the text is promoting derogatory and conspiratorial views, making it an example of implicit abuse."
18012,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses hyperbole and exaggeration in a humorous context, which is common in political debates. The use of the term 'warlock' and the fantastical description are more likely intended as a joke rather than a dehumanizing attack. The hashtag '#gopdebate' suggests a political context where such exaggerated language is often used for satirical or humorous purposes."
5483,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'were the duggars proposing religious freedom to molest act ? exec order from jindal coming ?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly promote prejudice or hatred towards any protected category.

The satirical and speculative nature of the text does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
1861,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes that all white people are racist, even those who are supporting a black man.

The context and language used do not align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
10655,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'it is central asia . not white .' is most consistently interpreted as a geographical clarification. The phrase 'not white' clarifies the demographic characteristics of the region without necessarily implying a derogatory remark.

11062,not_hate,0.9,"The text is expressing a personal disassociation from the Nazi regime, questioning why anyone would associate themselves with such a historically condemned group. The sarcastic tone reinforces the speaker's disdain for the regime. The use of sarcasm and mockery indicates a strong personal opinion against the regime and its ideologies, rather than promoting prejudice or hate."
4819,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily a call for political activism aimed at removing President Obama from office. The phrase 'remove Obama' suggests a desire for political change, and the hashtag '#ows' (Occupy Wall Street) indicates alignment with a movement known for its criticism of political and economic systems. The call to 'please retweet this all day ! !' suggests a strong push for widespread dissemination of the message, indicating a concerted effort to rally support.

11156,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'or a ""white"" ""male""' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning paths suggest that it is not implicit hate speech. The use of quotation marks around 'white' and 'male' could be for emphasis, clarity, neutral reporting, or a critique of privilege, rather than to convey derogatory or dismissive intent. The context does not clearly indicate coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
314,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'because it's a white identitarian group' can be interpreted as implying that the group is associated with white supremacy or racism. The term 'white identitarian' is often associated with groups that promote white supremacy, and cultural and social knowledge suggests that such groups are typically associated with racist ideologies. This interpretation relies on the common association of identitarian groups with supremacist ideologies."
10920,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies a negative and potentially abusive sentiment towards Muslims by suggesting that mosques are places where violent ideologies are taught. This targeting can be interpreted as an implicit bias or prejudice against Muslims, suggesting that their places of worship are associated with violent ideologies."
1635,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'shame on hindus who saw / supported pk' uses coded language and abstract references to criticize Hindus for their media consumption habits, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against a religious group.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
18258,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language to convey a harmful message against the white race. The phrase 'their goal to to extriminate white race' is direct but also subtle, requiring contextual knowledge to fully understand.

7017,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'is he bringing any sexual predators this time ? ?' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its use of coded language and abstract references to imply negative associations. The phrase 'sexual predators' is highly charged and suggests a pattern of harmful behavior, which can be interpreted as a stereotype or innuendo. The repetition of the question mark adds emphasis and sarcasm, reinforcing a critical and provocative tone. This interpretation aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, including sarcasm, stereotypes, and coded references."
11895,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'illegals,' which is derogatory and dehumanizing, often used to stigmatize undocumented immigrants. The call to 'fight against amnesty and illegals' and 'get back to 100 %' suggests a desire to eliminate or restrict the presence of undocumented immigrants, aligning with the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action.' The text also uses coded language to appeal to a specific audience, resonating with those who hold anti-immigration sentiments, making it easier to rally support against undocumented immigrants."
14026,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'the trump movement is white nationalism. to deny it is' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly fit the criteria for implicit hate speech. The statement is a strong criticism and could be seen as provocative or polarizing, but it does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes to promote prejudice. Instead, it directly criticizes a political movement, which is permissible expression."
5807,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on historical reflection, architectural critique, and cultural commentary, which are permissible expressions. While Interpretation 4 suggests a potential romanticized view, the overall context and the use of terms like 'haunting' and 'national socialists' do not promote prejudice but rather evoke a sense of the dark past. The text does not use coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice."
403,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language that relies on cultural and historical knowledge to convey an abusive message. The use of hashtags '#holocaust' and '#revisionist' in conjunction with 'patriot' and the name 'Horst Mahler' suggests a deeper, coded message. The term 'revisionist' in this context is often used to describe individuals who deny or minimize the Holocaust, which is widely considered abusive and offensive. The inclusion of 'patriot' could be interpreted as a sarcastic or ironic label, further emphasizing the abusive nature of the message."
11353,not_hate,0.9,"The statement 'because he is a populist' can be interpreted as a neutral description of the person's political style, indicating that they focus on the concerns and desires of the general public.

8258,not_hate,0.95,"The text does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories.

The text is focused on political and religious affiliations without any derogatory or prejudicial language."
2942,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'more white kids have to die' explicitly states a desire for the death of white children, which is a direct call for violence. The statement 'only then will whites understand racism' implies that this understanding can only be achieved through the death of white children, which is a form of incitement. The word 'disgusting' at the end could be interpreted as the author's reaction to the statement, indicating their disapproval of the sentiment, but it does not negate the hateful nature of the original statement."
1857,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text mentions '#unitetheright' and 'Charlottesville' on 'August 12,' which directly ties it to the 2017 'Unite the Right' rally, a notorious event organized by white supremacists and neo-Nazis. By announcing a live event at this specific location and date, the text implicitly supports or promotes an event associated with hate and violence."
195,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the highly charged and inflammatory phrase 'white genocide,' which is a known conspiracy theory suggesting a systematic effort to eliminate the white race. The term 'endgame' adds a sense of urgency and finality, implying that the situation is critical and requires immediate attention. The inclusion of '#youtube' and 'full' suggests that the documentary is comprehensive and easily accessible, making it a tool for incitement. The overall tone and language are designed to provoke strong emotional reactions and mobilize viewers to take some form of action or spread the message further, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
15391,not_hate,0.95,"The phrase 'racist tweets' is used in a descriptive manner across all interpretations.

This can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and sarcasm to convey prejudicial attitudes towards these groups."
5741,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text '* warning * danger white' can be interpreted as a racial slur suggesting that white people are dangerous. This interpretation relies on cultural and social knowledge, where 'white' is understood to refer to people of Caucasian descent. The word 'danger' implies a threat, suggesting that white people are threatening or dangerous. This implication is derogatory and offensive, fitting into the category of implicit abuse."
7468,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language to convey hate speech without explicitly stating it. The term 'anti-white' and the hashtag '#whitegenocide' are used to imply a broader, more sinister narrative about the perceived threat to white people.

17569,not_hate,0.95,"The text explicitly mentions 'European rabbis' demanding laws to ban 'anti-Semitic hate speech,' which aligns with advocacy for protection against hate speech rather than promoting it. The use of quotation marks around 'anti-Semitic hate speech' could be seen as emphasizing the specific type of hate speech being addressed, rather than expressing skepticism or irony. The overall tone and content suggest a proactive stance against hate speech."
20248,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text expresses a strong desire for severe punishment and deportation of a group of individuals, implying that they are not welcome in the current country and should be removed.

The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey these harmful ideas without using explicit hate language."
20690,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text suggests that immigrants or refugees should not come to the speaker's country if they are not satisfied with the conditions, which fits the criteria for a 'Call for Action' subtype of implicit abuse. The phrase 'if they don't like the conditions' implies dissatisfaction with the conditions in the speaker's country, and 'stay in your own country!' is a directive urging the group to remain in their country of origin, implying that they are not welcome in the speaker's country."
17939,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'i'm white ... married to black man 9 years ... do i count ?' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

3823,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reinforces stereotypes about Mexican immigrants by suggesting that they are taking advantage of a welfare system rather than contributing to it. This portrayal aligns with common stereotypes that immigrants, particularly from Mexico, are taking advantage of welfare systems rather than contributing to the economy.

None of these interpretations suggest implicit hate speech."
18076,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'no ! only white ice is allowed !' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The phrase 'white ice' is not a common or literal term, suggesting a metaphorical or euphemistic use. In many cultures, 'white' is often used as a euphemism for Caucasian or European descent. The phrase 'only white ice is allowed' implies that anything other than 'white ice' is not acceptable, which can be interpreted as excluding non-white individuals. The use of coded language to convey a racist sentiment falls under implicit abuse, as it disguises the abusive intent."
1019,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'rt : headlining today's washington update ""left to their own devices""' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

14863,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text employs coded language and abstract references to dismiss the concept of 'white privilege' and belittle those who believe in it. The use of 'liberal extremists' and the dismissive tone towards 'white privilege' suggest a broader dismissal of social justice issues.

This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
11709,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'oliver north ? ? ? #vvs16 really .' is ambiguous and lacks explicit content that directly targets any protected category.

4185,not_hate,0.95,"The text explicitly mentions 'not a black / white / brown issue,' which suggests that the speaker is moving beyond racial divisions.

12567,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'no these are just normal people you racist idiot.' is primarily a direct insult and dismissal. The phrase 'you racist idiot' is a direct insult aimed at the person being addressed, rather than a coded or abstract reference to a protected category. The use of 'no' indicates disagreement, and 'these are just normal people' suggests that the speaker believes the other person is overreacting or misjudging a situation.

18437,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'she's white' followed by 'lol way to be reductive here.' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The use of 'lol' and the phrase 'way to be reductive here' suggests a critique of oversimplification rather than any form of hate speech. The interpretations provided do not indicate any intent to promote prejudice or demean any protected category."
4910,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text accuses Bill Clinton of racial bias by attempting to replace a black Democrat with a white Democrat through gerrymandering. The use of the word 'racist' at the end directly accuses Clinton of racial bias, which aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse categorized as 'Perpetrators.' This interpretation fits within the category of implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes."
8729,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to demean a specific demographic group ('old white guys') by associating them with ignorance and hate. The rhetorical questions and dismissive tone reinforce negative stereotypes, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
4872,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to criticize a particular religion, implying that it is not peaceful or loving despite its claims. This sarcastic tone and implicit critique can be seen as a form of implicit abuse, promoting prejudice against the religion and its followers."
10691,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily aimed at clarifying a misconception and defending a group from being unfairly associated with a negative action or behavior. The speaker uses statistical evidence to counter a generalization, which does not promote prejudice or use coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes. The overall tone is defensive and conciliatory, aiming to correct a perceived injustice or misrepresentation."
4076,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and an ominous tone to suggest an impending negative outcome for 'lefties,' which can be interpreted as a veiled threat. The term 'lefties' is often used derogatorily, and the overall tone is threatening, implying that the nationalist shift is just the beginning of something worse for left-wing individuals. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes."
3445,not_hate,0.95,"The most consistent reasoning is that the text is discussing organizational leadership, advocacy, or community initiatives. It refers to 'people now being censored' in a general sense, without any specific references to race, religion, or other protected characteristics. The conditional nature of the statement suggests a willingness to lead if certain conditions are met, which does not imply any form of prejudice or hate."
10840,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the hashtag '#whitegenocide,' which is a known coded reference to a conspiracy theory suggesting that white people are being systematically replaced or eliminated. This hashtag is often used to promote racist and xenophobic views. The inclusion of '#activism' and '#trump' suggests alignment with political movements or figures that may support or propagate these views. The phrase 'simple but effective' reinforces the call for action or the belief in the straightforward and impactful nature of the message, which is inherently abusive. The context and cultural knowledge are necessary to understand the abusive implication of this hashtag."
12673,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains racial and gender-based undertones intended to demean the recipient based on their perceived desirability to a specific demographic. The phrase 'no white man worth his salt would look at you anyway' introduces a racial element, suggesting that the recipient is undesirable to a specific racial group. The statement also implies that the recipient's worth is tied to their desirability to men, reinforcing gender-based stereotypes. This interpretation is supported by the use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
16583,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and sarcasm to highlight the hypocrisy of the person being addressed, who is accused of hating Muslims. The speaker's response 'i hate regressive idiots like you that hold america back' is a derogatory comparison meant to highlight the person's flaws. The sarcastic statement 'i guess we're even' underscores the speaker's belief that the person's hatred is as baseless as their own derogatory statement. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language and sarcasm to convey prejudicial attitudes."
10179,not_hate,0.9,"The text emphasizes the unfairness of judging people based on characteristics they cannot control, such as race. It argues against racial discrimination and advocates for fairness and acceptance, which aligns with a general statement against prejudice rather than promoting hate."
2929,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice and extremist ideologies. The phrase 'for blood and soil' is historically associated with Nazi ideology, which advocates for ethnic nationalism and violence against perceived outsiders.

9619,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial supremacy and dehumanize non-white individuals. The phrases 'giddy up guys' and 'lasso yourselves right away' suggest treating people as animals, which is dehumanizing.

14164,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text is a rhetorical question meant to criticize and insult Muslims by implying that they are inherently violent and anti-Semitic. The question is not meant to elicit a genuine answer but rather to reinforce negative stereotypes and prejudices. The text suggests that Muslims commit hate crimes against Jews during their prayers, which is a stereotype. The text depicts Muslims as responsible for crimes or immoral acts, aligning with the subtype of implicit abuse identified in the analysis."
13122,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not target individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Instead, it focuses on political figures and a media outlet, which are not protected categories. The language used, while potentially inciting action against a magazine, does not constitute hate speech as defined. The text uses terms like 'hit job' and '18 cr. deal' to frame the magazine as biased and corrupt, but this does not dehumanize or use slurs against any protected group."
15254,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'it's a scientific fact that the white race is superior. #opkkk' uses coded language and abstract references to promote white supremacy. The phrase 'it's a scientific fact' is a false claim intended to give legitimacy to a prejudicial belief. The hashtag '#opkkk' is a coded reference to the Ku Klux Klan, a well-known white supremacist organization. This combination of false scientific claims and coded language strongly suggests implicit hate speech."
2584,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily focuses on the performance of Canadian white expatriate CEOs in South Africa and their dismissals. While the inclusion of 'non-racist' could be interpreted as addressing a stereotype, it does not directly promote prejudice or use coded language to convey hate. The most consistent reasoning is that the text is a factual report or a critique of performance, rather than implicit hate speech."

The hashtags and context suggest political rhetoric rather than implicit hate speech."
9279,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses the phrase 'make america great again' in a sarcastic, satirical, or ironic manner to critique political policies and actions. While it mentions controversial topics such as DACA, refugee intake, and Middle East wars, it does not directly target or dehumanize any protected category. The text is more likely a critique of political rhetoric and policies rather than an attempt to promote prejudice or incite hatred."
17456,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to imply that feminists are biased and that Jewish people are responsible for societal problems. The hashtag '#withjewswelose' is particularly offensive and promotes prejudice against Jewish people. The rhetorical question about feminists not addressing the abuse of white women also suggests a bias, reinforcing negative stereotypes."
9713,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text suggests that non-white individuals frequently make false claims to get white people fired or exiled. This generalization perpetuates a negative stereotype about non-white people, implying they are manipulative and dishonest. The use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
11256,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'Adolf Hitler: England does not want peace - 8th November 1939 (video)' is a historical reference to a statement made by Adolf Hitler during World War II. While Hitler is a figure associated with hateful ideologies, the statement itself does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a historical documentation of a significant statement made during a critical period in history, which is valuable for historical analysis and understanding the political climate of the time. The context and the lack of direct or indirect hateful language suggest that it should not be classified as implicit hate speech."
15859,not_hate,0.85,"The text is neutrally reporting on an article that discusses the alt-right's reactions to Trump's actions. The phrase 'said alt righties overreact to trump moves' could be a direct quote or summary from the article. The text does not include any additional commentary or judgment, suggesting it is merely reporting the content of the article."
1841,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to indirectly convey prejudicial attitudes. The term 'racist white man' and the comparison to 'the very symbol of the patriarchy' are abstract references that promote negative stereotypes without using explicit hate language.

1763,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to express anger and resentment towards a group that is perceived as unfairly labeling others as racist. The phrase 'u can stick that hood where the sun don't shine' is a vulgar and dismissive remark, and the term 'you freaks' is a negative comparison that dehumanizes the group. The statement 'call every white person against illegal immigration racist' generalizes beliefs about a group of people, suggesting that anyone against illegal immigration is labeled as racist. This combination of elements indicates implicit hate speech directed towards a group perceived as overly sensitive or judgmental."
4384,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on political advocacy and legislative actions, such as repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood.

15563,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses a satirical tone to mock the perceived hypocrisy of liberals who are more fearful of domestic threats (white men) than foreign threats (Syrian refugees). This satire highlights the perceived inconsistency in liberal views on threats and safety, which can be seen as promoting prejudice through coded language and stereotypes."
11187,not_hate,0.85,The text primarily critiques media sensationalism rather than promoting prejudice. The use of 'omg nazis everywhere' in quotation marks and the skeptical tone suggest a critique of media practices rather than a dismissal of the issue itself. There is no direct or indirect promotion of prejudice against any protected category.
1828,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text perpetuates stereotypes about Muslims, portraying them as having multiple wives and high fertility rates, and blaming them for the decline of the white population.

10912,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'the northwest front . all white  all straight .' explicitly mentions racial and sexual orientation characteristics, implying that individuals who do not fit these criteria are not welcome.

3591,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'time to get the truth about radical islam or buy a casket no joke' contains coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice against a religious group. The phrase 'buy a casket' implies a threat of death, which can be interpreted as inciting fear and encouraging harmful actions against members of the religious group. The urgency and seriousness conveyed by 'no joke' further emphasize the threat, making it a strong example of implicit hate speech."
11920,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'when cernovich says the #altright are controlled opposhishion.' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of these interpretations directly or indirectly promote prejudice against any protected category. The term 'controlled opposhishion' is a play on 'controlled opposition,' suggesting manipulation or lack of authenticity, which is more aligned with political criticism or conspiracy theory rather than hate speech. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice based on race, religion, or other protected characteristics."
14532,not_hate,0.95,The text critiques inconsistent policy-making and highlights hypocrisy in healthcare support decisions. It does not target any protected category or use coded language to promote prejudice. The use of 'mean spirited' is a general criticism rather than a targeted attack.
3946,not_hate,0.9,"The text is criticizing a decision made by the Supreme Court, suggesting that the court's protection of certain behavior is unjust or flawed. The term 'vile' is a strong negative judgment, indicating that the behavior in question is morally reprehensible. The phrase 'the sup . ct . said' implies that the Supreme Court has made a ruling. The combination of these elements suggests that the speaker disagrees with the court's decision to protect such behavior under free speech laws. This interpretation requires cultural and contextual knowledge to understand the criticism directed at the judicial system."

14638,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'this man is not black and i am not white - we are americans' can be interpreted as dismissing the significance of racial identity, which may be insensitive to the unique challenges faced by different racial groups. However, this interpretation does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech as it does not promote prejudice or use coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes. Instead, it can be seen as promoting unity and equality, albeit in a potentially problematic way."
17906,not_hate,0.85,"The speaker is simply stating their racial and cultural identity without any malicious intent. The phrase 'i don't mean to sound racist' suggests the speaker is aware of potential sensitivities and is trying to preemptively clarify their intentions. 'white is what i am' is a straightforward statement of the speaker's racial identity. 'no judgment call on that' indicates that the speaker is not making any value judgments about their identity. 'western hindu also' adds another layer to their identity, indicating a blend of Western and Hindu cultural influences."
4125,not_hate,0.9,"The statement 'i can see you really hate people who like the wall' is a straightforward observation about someone's feelings.

7120,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards a specific racial or ethnic group. It accuses this group of committing heinous acts such as enslaving, raping, and forcing white women into marriage, and suggests that members of this group will kill their own people for engaging in interracial relationships.

20279,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice against immigrants. The phrase 'go ice!' can be interpreted as a call to action for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take action. The term 'bad hombres' is a derogatory reference to immigrants, particularly those from Latin America, suggesting they are criminals or undesirable. The hashtags '#deportthemall' and '#buildthewall' reinforce the idea of taking action against immigrants, specifically deporting them and building a wall to prevent further immigration. The hashtag '#maga' aligns with political rhetoric that often includes anti-immigrant sentiments."
18888,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to critique the denial of white privilege, highlighting the absurdity of such views. This interpretation is the most consistent with the text's tone and context, suggesting that it is a satirical commentary rather than implicit hate speech."
9898,implicit_hate,0.85,"The question 'do u like non-white people?' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its rhetorical nature implying racism, potential stereotyping, dehumanization, and provocative intent.

1649,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly mentions that it is 'expected' for Black or Hispanic people to be on welfare and uneducated, which is a harmful stereotype. The contrast with white people being considered 'pathetic' in the same situation underscores societal bias and stereotypes. The use of the word 'racist' at the end suggests a critical awareness of these stereotypes, but the overall tone and content still reinforce negative stereotypes about a protected category."
17347,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'this should frighten everyone ! meat plant raises the steaks for freedom :' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The interpretations provided suggest that the text is either a humorous play on words, a critique of industrial practices, a satirical commentary on freedom, an attention-grabbing headline, or a social commentary on consumerism. None of these interpretations align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
1226,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reinforces harmful racial stereotypes by associating black individuals with criminal behavior and white nationalist skinheads with violence. The phrase 'black serial armed robber' directly links a specific racial group with criminal activity, and 'disguised himself as a white nationalist skinhead' suggests that white nationalist skinheads are inherently violent or dangerous, reinforcing negative stereotypes about this group. The combination of these elements perpetuates the idea that black individuals are criminals and white nationalist skinheads are violent, which can be offensive and implicitly abusive."
10276,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcastic language and hashtags that indirectly convey a negative stereotype about Islam, suggesting that it is not a peaceful religion. The use of '#religionofpeace' in a sarcastic manner and '#youaintnomuslimbruv' to disassociate the perpetrator from true Muslims can be seen as coded language promoting prejudice against Muslims."
19330,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text makes a generalized statement about Muslims, suggesting that they are inherently incompatible with Western society. This is a form of stereotyping that paints an entire group with a broad brush, ignoring individual differences and complexities. The phrase 'muslims as a whole' indicates a generalization about all Muslims, and the statement 'aren't compatible w/ western society' implies a stereotypical belief that Muslims cannot integrate or coexist peacefully within Western societies. The use of 'nobody wants to admit' suggests a perceived reluctance to acknowledge this supposed incompatibility, which could be interpreted as a subtle accusation against those who do not share this view."
1131,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily criticizes the Obama administration for attempting to manipulate the definition of race to include Islam, which is a factual claim about religion versus race. While it could be interpreted as sarcastic or ironic, there is no direct or indirect promotion of prejudice against any protected category. The text does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes. Instead, it focuses on political criticism and potential misunderstandings."
19884,not_hate,0.85,"The text is primarily a sarcastic expression of strong dislike or contempt for an individual named Georgie, rather than a literal call for harm. The sarcastic tone and the context suggest that the speaker is using hyperbolic language to express their feelings, which does not directly target a protected category or promote prejudice."
19029,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a belief in maintaining a certain racial composition, which can be interpreted as promoting racial purity.

20557,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and exaggeration to mock the idea of open borders, which can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice against immigrants or supporters of open borders. The use of extreme and impractical suggestions (removing doors and windows) and the underlying message that open borders are unreasonable align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
6425,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to racial dynamics and sexual behavior to demean the target.

There are no coded references, abstract language, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
20468,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses exaggerated and stereotypical punishments to incite fear and hatred towards Muslims and Islamic law. The hashtag '#noshariainamerica' and the mention of 'burka' and 'rape' are cultural references often used to portray Islam negatively. The text also suggests that loyalty to America is seen as a crime under Sharia, which is a gross misrepresentation aimed at inciting fear."
9973,not_hate,0.9,"The text uses sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of the idea that someone who is Ashkenazi and Slavic could join the KKK and be pro-Jewish. The KKK is known for its anti-Semitic and racist views, making it impossible for someone from these groups to join. The sarcastic tone and the phrase 'thank god' suggest that the speaker is critiquing the prejudice and hypocrisy of the KKK's ideology rather than promoting hate."
1678,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language ('pro-white') and emphasizes the growth of the white population, which can be interpreted as promoting racial superiority and reinforcing negative stereotypes about non-white populations."
15189,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote stereotypes about a particular racial or cultural group. The phrase 'white bread' and 'white cars' could be interpreted as symbols of a specific group, and the phrase 'no cause y u know' suggests an unspoken, understood reason that is likely derogatory. The use of 'i guess' implies a casual or dismissive attitude towards the stereotype."
8495,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text mentions a Muslim individual attempting to join the Islamic State, a known terrorist organization. This association implicitly suggests that Muslims are prone to engaging in terrorist activities, which aligns with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse.'

6244,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'rep . steve king gets shamelessly racist or not | the occidental observer - white identity interests and culture' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its coded language and abstract references to white identity interests and culture. The phrase 'or not' suggests a questioning or defense of Representative Steve King's alleged racist behavior, which can be seen as promoting prejudicial attitudes indirectly. The term 'occidental observer' and the focus on 'white identity interests and culture' can be interpreted as a defense of white supremacist ideology, implying that such a focus is legitimate and not inherently racist or discriminatory."
1238,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards Muslims. The phrase 'anti-immigration conference attacked by a band of islamists' reinforces negative stereotypes about Muslims being violent and disruptive. This indirectly promotes prejudice without using explicit hate language.

While it references a serious allegation, it does not target any protected category with abuse or promote prejudice. The humor and sarcasm are directed at the absurdity of the claim rather than at any individual or group based on their protected characteristics."
870,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'white guilt ? hah !' uses sarcasm and a dismissive tone to belittle the concept of 'white guilt,' which is a coded reference to racial issues.

11629,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text can be interpreted as perpetuating an anti-Semitic stereotype by attributing blame for a controversial historical event to Jews.

2991,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'alt-right' is commonly associated with far-right ideologies, which often include elements of racism, white nationalism, and other forms of extremism. By referring to 'two of my favorite alt-right accounts,' the speaker is indicating a preference for these accounts, which implies an endorsement of the ideologies promoted by these accounts. Given the known associations of the alt-right with extremist views, the speaker is implicitly endorsing these harmful ideologies."
2770,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language that is often associated with white supremacist ideologies. The idea that 'white people deserve a homeland' aligns with the belief in white superiority and the need for a separate, exclusive space for white people. The claim that 'whites are becoming minorities in their own countries' is a common narrative in white supremacist circles, suggesting a fear of demographic change and loss of power. The accusation 'why are you anti-white' reinforces the idea that any opposition to these views is seen as an attack on white people, further promoting a divisive and exclusionary mindset."
7274,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'there are white muslims too ! muslims is not a race !' is most consistently interpreted as educational clarification, response to stereotyping, promotion of inclusivity, correction of misinformation, and defense against discrimination. None of these interpretations suggest the use of coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, the text aims to clarify misconceptions, promote inclusivity, and defend against discrimination, which aligns with permissible expressions rather than implicit hate speech."
9126,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'too busy with fake news' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. While it can be interpreted as dismissive or critical, it does not target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics. The most consistent reasoning is that it is a critique of media focus or a deflection tactic, neither of which qualifies as implicit hate speech."
14597,implicit_hate,0.9,The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial superiority and exclusivity. The phrase 'the last bastion of the white race' implies a threat to white dominance and the need to preserve it. The claim that '90% of young Finnish people oppose more non-white immigration' reinforces this narrative by suggesting widespread support for anti-immigration sentiments based on race.
5577,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'you fergot anti-straight white male meaning not for heterosexuial males who happen to be white' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly indicate implicit hate speech.

2842,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'does white identity mean white supremacy?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning paths suggest it is not implicit hate speech. The question can be a genuine attempt to understand a complex issue, a provocative discussion starter, or an educational tool. These interpretations do not involve coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The context and intent behind the question are crucial, and without explicit derogatory language or clear intent to promote prejudice, it is classified as not hate speech."
18925,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'they are running up and down the street screaming kill the white people' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to promote fear and division. The phrase 'kill the white people' is designed to evoke fear and mistrust, and the context of 'running up and down the street screaming' adds a sense of urgency and chaos. This overall message could be part of a broader effort to spread misinformation and create social unrest, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
460,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to instill fear and mistrust towards communists, suggesting they pose a significant threat to the nation. The phrase 'they will destroy our life' directly attributes harmful intentions to communists, and the statement 'you don't want a communist in the White House' implies that having a communist in power would be detrimental. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it promotes prejudice without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
17343,not_hate,0.95,"The text expresses genuine concern about a sad situation and urges the newly appointed BJP government to take action.

16955,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text perpetuates a racist stereotype about Black people, suggesting they are incapable of managing or sustaining a large retail establishment like Walmart. The phrase 'the blacks there' generalizes about a group of people based on their race, and the statement 'incapable of sustaining a walmart' attributes a negative characteristic to this group. The mention of Tuskegee, a historically significant location for African Americans, adds context that reinforces the racial stereotype. The use of 'haha' at the beginning suggests a dismissive or mocking tone, further indicating that the statement is meant to be derogatory."
17133,not_hate,0.9,"The text is neutrally reporting on an aspect of movement conservatism without passing judgment. It does not contain any overtly critical or supportive language, and it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

11678,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language ('#whitegenocide') and stereotypes ('blacks and Hispanics' as perpetrators of violence) to promote prejudice against these groups. The call for action to 'put an end to #whitegenocide' aligns with far-right ideologies that promote white victimhood and the need for protective measures, which is a form of implicit hate speech."
121,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against African refugees. The use of quotation marks around 'refugee' suggests a derogatory tone, and the emphasis on the individual's African background and the immediacy of the crime perpetuates negative stereotypes and incites fear."
15362,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'only white people can be racist' generalizes that all white people are racist, which is a stereotype and can be seen as implicit abuse. This generalization is a form of stereotyping, which is harmful and reductive. Stereotyping can be a form of implicit abuse as it dehumanizes and oversimplifies a group of people."
961,not_hate,1.0,"The phrase 'tear down that wall!' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The interpretations provided highlight historical, metaphorical, literal, rhetorical, and artistic contexts, all of which emphasize positive intentions such as freedom, unity, and overcoming challenges.

16063,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'hellstorm : the rape of germany ( video ) #swrm via' uses highly charged and offensive language ('the rape of germany') that is likely to provoke strong emotions and could be seen as abusive or inflammatory. The hashtag '#swrm' might be used to target a specific audience or community that is likely to react strongly to such content. The term 'via' suggests that the content is being disseminated to reach a wider audience, potentially to spread a particular narrative or ideology. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
21350,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statements made by the old woman and her husband imply a classist attitude, suggesting that those who rely on social welfare programs are inferior. The use of coded language and stereotypes perpetuates a negative judgment about economically disadvantaged groups, reinforcing class divisions. The overall tone of the conversation suggests an elitist perspective, where those who do not conform to their standards of self-reliance are looked down upon."
19511,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to dehumanize and mock a particular racial or ethnic group. The phrase 'spoken like a true nonwhite' generalizes and stereotypes nonwhite people, and 'a race who shits on the streets' dehumanizes them by likening them to animals or objects in a derogatory manner. The sarcastic tone of 'pinnacle civilization lmao' reinforces the abusive intent."
17177,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and rhetorical questions to mock and provoke reactions against 'white advocacy,' which can be seen as a coded reference to racial issues. The sarcastic tone and the implication that anger towards white advocacy is unjustified can be interpreted as promoting prejudicial attitudes indirectly."

The text focuses on legal and political activism rather than targeting any group with abuse or dehumanization."
17294,not_hate,0.95,"The text discusses a legal concept known as the 'free ex claim,' which requires complex analysis under specific legal frameworks.

1807,not_hate,0.8,"The text 'when i say white i mean a' is incomplete and lacks sufficient context to definitively classify it as implicit hate speech. While it could potentially be interpreted as coded language (Interpretation 4), the absence of a complete thought makes it difficult to determine the intended meaning. Other interpretations, such as metaphorical meaning, clarification of terminology, or a typographical error, are equally plausible and do not inherently suggest hate speech."
20882,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text contains a direct quote from a political leader that calls for violence against a specific racial group ('Go After the White Man. We Are Cutting the Throat of Whiteness'). This quote is a clear example of dehumanization and incitement to violence, which are key features of hate speech. The sarcastic attribution of blame to different political groups does not negate the hateful content of the quote itself."
6221,not_hate,1.0,"The text 'people like and have risked everything for everyone but themselves please support them.' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it promotes support and recognition for individuals who have made significant sacrifices for others.

1077,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text mentions 'george rockwell,' who is known for founding the American Nazi Party. The question 'are you carrying on the work of george rockwell ?' suggests an interest in whether the recipient is continuing Rockwell's ideological or political work. The phrase 'i liked your site' indicates a positive impression of the recipient's online presence, which could be related to the ideological content. This interpretation suggests that the sender is asking if the recipient is aligned with or continuing the extremist, racist, and hateful ideologies of George Lincoln Rockwell. The positive remark about the site suggests approval of this alignment."
2780,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'white supremacy at its best ! where is tariq nasheed ?' is most consistently interpreted as a sarcastic critique of white supremacy, highlighting its negative impact and questioning why Tariq Nasheed, a known activist, is not addressing the issue. The phrase 'white supremacy at its best' is sarcastic, implying that white supremacy is inherently negative. The mention of Tariq Nasheed, known for his activism against racism, suggests that the speaker believes Nasheed should be more vocal or active in addressing the situation. The rhetorical question 'where is tariq nasheed ?' is not seeking a literal answer but is meant to criticize or draw attention to Nasheed's perceived inaction."
5408,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to accuse the other person of racism and ignorance. The phrase 'then why do you use the word white ?' suggests that the use of the word 'white' is problematic and indicative of racism. The statement 'youre the racist' directly accuses the person of being racist. The phrase 'pure idiocy' is a negative comparison, implying that the person being addressed is idiotic. The sarcastic remark 'get a vocabulary' suggests that the person is ignorant or unintelligent, further dismissing their intelligence. This interpretation is consistent with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect and coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
5145,implicit_hate,0.75,The text can be seen as a coded way to justify or normalize racist attitudes by suggesting that pride in being white should be exempt from criticism. This interpretation is supported by the broader social context where white pride has historically been associated with racist ideologies.

7519,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language to imply that anti-racist efforts are a form of discrimination against white people. The phrase 'they say they are anti-racist but what they really are is anti-white' relies on subtle language and cultural context, implying that anti-racist efforts are actually a form of discrimination, which is an abusive implication. This interpretation requires an understanding of the broader social and political discourse to fully grasp the intended meaning."
14499,implicit_hate,0.75,"The phrase 'hey white brother' explicitly mentions race, and in certain contexts, addressing someone by their race can be seen as derogatory or condescending. The use of 'brother' in this context might be sarcastic or mocking, implying a lack of genuine camaraderie.

12394,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'i consider myself to be alt - south' can be interpreted in multiple neutral ways, such as identifying with a regional identity, a political or ideological movement, a cultural or social group, a personal style, or using sarcasm or irony. None of these interpretations clearly fall under implicit abuse or promote prejudice against any protected categories. Therefore, the text does not contain implicit hate speech."
21052,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses a comparative structure to devalue feminists by suggesting they lack a valid point or purpose. This comparison is offensive and dehumanizing, aligning with the definition of implicit hate speech.

9266,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'you're making me look for a short rope hunter ! !' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The phrase 'short rope' is a euphemism for suicide, and 'hunter' appears to be a direct address to an individual. The text expresses extreme frustration, a call for help, or manipulative behavior rather than implicit hate speech."
483,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily criticizes an individual within a movement and suggests that the movement has been 'hijacked,' which could imply internal or external issues. However, there are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories. The mention of 'some good people in that movement' further suggests a nuanced view rather than a prejudicial one."
2841,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'democrats coca cola' '? is there a separate one for cons?' is most consistently interpreted as a humorous or sarcastic comment about the political affiliations of beverage choices. The juxtaposition of 'democrats' and 'coca cola' is unusual and could be seen as humorous. The question 'is there a separate one for cons?' could be interpreted as a playful or sarcastic inquiry. The use of 'cons' in a light-hearted manner suggests a humorous tone rather than a serious critique. The overall context does not indicate a serious political discussion but rather a playful observation. There is no evidence of coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
5354,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily a criticism of FAIR and a call to action against intolerance, rather than promoting prejudice or hate. It references the SPLC's classification of FAIR as a hate group and labels FAIR as a white supremacist organization, which is a strong accusation but not implicit hate speech. The phrase 'dont tolerate intolerance !' encourages opposition to intolerance, which aligns with social responsibility and awareness rather than promoting hate."
3403,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text identifies a specific group ('antifa / leftists') and labels them as 'domestic terrorists,' which is a form of implicit abuse by attributing negative characteristics to a group. The statement 'no doubt trump not calling out' suggests that Trump's inaction is directly responsible for the emboldening of this group. The sarcastic 'great job trump!' reinforces the blame and criticism directed at Trump. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
1855,not_hate,0.9,"The text is simply providing information about a resource that explains the differences between various pride movements, including gay pride, Asian pride, black pride, and white pride. It lists different types of pride movements without any explicit judgment or bias and encourages further learning, which aligns with an educational purpose."
1241,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'btw islam isn't a race !' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it often appears in contexts where discussions about Islamophobia are taking place. By emphasizing that Islam is not a race, the speaker may be implying that anti-Muslim sentiment is not a form of racism, which can be seen as a way to downplay the seriousness of prejudice against Muslims. Additionally, the casual tone and exclamation mark could be seen as a provocation or challenge to the validity of concerns about Islamophobia, potentially stirring controversy or debate."
7438,implicit_hate,0.75,"The statement 'you're not white' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech in contexts where it is used to exclude, discriminate, or provoke based on race. It can act as a microaggression, subtly conveying discriminatory attitudes without using explicit hate language."
9774,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'lets turn our hate into action' is a clear call to action based on negative emotions, which is a strong indicator of implicit hate speech. The context of the 'Liverpool white man march' suggests racial or ethnic tensions, and the term 'action report' implies a detailed plan or documentation of actions taken, which could include harmful or violent activities. The phrase 'read more' suggests additional content that elaborates on the harmful actions being promoted. These elements together strongly suggest incitement to discrimination, promotion of hate speech, and encouragement of vigilantism."
19392,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates a derogatory stereotype about Indians, suggesting poor hygiene practices, and implies British cultural superiority. The phrase 'shitting in the street' is a clear derogatory stereotype, and the mention of 'race breeds culture' suggests inherent cultural differences based on race. The reference to the British trying to change this behavior implies a sense of cultural superiority and a colonial mindset."
19253,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'you're a smart guy, what color is your wife?' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The phrase 'what color is your wife?' is not a typical or polite way to ask about someone's spouse and implies a racist or derogatory assumption about the person's spouse based on their race or ethnicity. The term 'color' in this context is often used to refer to race or ethnicity, and by asking this question, the speaker implies that the intelligence of the person being addressed is somehow related to the race or ethnicity of their spouse. This suggests an underlying prejudice or stereotype, making it an implicitly abusive statement."
12724,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that Jews are responsible for negative or immoral acts, specifically Miley Cyrus's antics. The hashtag '#withjewswelose' explicitly ties the malevolent force to Jews, aligning with the subtype of implicit abuse where identity groups are depicted as responsible for crimes or immoral acts."
16967,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to imply that Heidi Cruz is part of a nefarious global conspiracy, often associated with anti-Semitic or xenophobic sentiments. The term 'nwo globalist' and the mention of 'international bankers' and 'Goldman Sachs' reinforce these negative connotations, which are commonly used in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. The text relies on cultural and social knowledge to convey an abusive implication, suggesting that Heidi Cruz is part of a malevolent group."
17120,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily targets an individual for their political actions or policies, using derogatory language that is common in political discourse. While the term 'scumbag' is harsh, it does not specifically target a protected category based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics. The context suggests political criticism rather than implicit hate speech."
13883,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey a derogatory message about racial identity. The phrase 'the raceless adventures of justin white' can be interpreted as a veiled racial insult, implying that someone named Justin White is 'raceless' or lacking in racial identity. The hashtag '#tcot' adds a political context, suggesting that the comment is part of a broader conservative narrative that might include derogatory remarks about racial issues. The use of humor and the play on words can be seen as a way to disguise the insult, making it more socially acceptable."
18336,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text singles out 'white women' and 'white kids' as groups that need protection, which could indicate an implicit bias. The question format and the incomplete sentence suggest a belief that other groups do not require the same level of protection, promoting prejudice indirectly."
19819,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests handing an individual over to a military unit known for its harsh treatment, with the implication that something unpleasant or violent will happen. This aligns with the 'Call for Action' subtype of implicit abuse, where harmful actions are urged against a person. The context and cultural knowledge support the interpretation that the speaker is threatening the individual with harm, which is a form of implicit hate speech."
19130,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the term 'illegal alien parasite' to dehumanize undocumented immigrants by comparing them to non-human organisms, which are typically seen as harmful and burdensome. This indirectly conveys a prejudicial attitude towards undocumented immigrants without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
7215,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'some folks are just not big picture people - -' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning is that it acknowledges different strengths in individuals.

The phrase 'people like us' does not explicitly target any protected category with abuse or dehumanization."
164,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial supremacy and violence against an unspecified group. The phrase 'they smother the good white people of america' suggests that an unspecified group is oppressing 'good white people,' and 'they need to be hung brother' is a direct call for violent action. The regional connotation of 'brother 'south' '!' adds a historical context of racial tension and violence, making it implicit hate speech."
573,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'lol you're jewish though . not white .' reinforces a harmful stereotype that Jewish people are not considered white.

The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
8149,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey a message of racial animosity and victimization. Phrases like 'the growing anti-white agenda' and 'obamas overt cleansing of white america' imply a concerted effort to harm white Americans, which can be interpreted as implicitly abusive.

4580,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'white genocide in america 1960-2060 | read more : via' uses coded language and abstract references to suggest a systematic threat against the white population. The term 'white genocide' is often used in extremist rhetoric to imply a conspiracy against white people, which can incite fear, division, and potentially justify extremist actions. The timeframe '1960-2060' suggests a long-term, ongoing process, and the 'read more : via' indicates a call to action or further engagement with the narrative. These elements collectively promote prejudice and fear, classifying the text as implicit hate speech."

8590,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text mentions 'relics of the waffen-ss' in a positive light ('amazing'), which could be seen as glorifying the group. The Waffen-SS is known for its role in World War II and the Holocaust, making any positive portrayal sensitive and potentially offensive.

It reports a factual event: 'Hong Kong police start removing protest barricades.' There is no use of derogatory language, sarcasm, or rhetorical questions.

1096,not_hate,0.85,"The text points out that slavery was not exclusively a racial issue but also involved class and power dynamics within the same racial group. By mentioning 'white people who didn't know their ancestors were enslaved by other white people,' the text could be aiming to highlight the complexity of historical slavery. This interpretation suggests that the text is trying to broaden the discussion to include all forms of slavery, not just those based on race. The intent could be to encourage a more nuanced understanding of historical injustices, rather than dismissing them."

12587,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text perpetuates racial stereotypes by suggesting that black people are either not genuine (i.e., 'twitter bots') or have self-hatred. The phrase 'unless they're black' specifically targets black individuals, and the suggestions to 'call them a twitter bot' and 'say they hate themselves' further stereotype and devalue black people by attributing inauthenticity and self-hatred to them. This combination of generalizations and negative attributions constitutes implicit abuse through stereotyping."

9444,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to perpetuate racial stereotypes, suggesting that black people are responsible for negative outcomes in Newark. The phrase 'stuff black people don't like' generalizes a belief about a group of people, which is a form of stereotyping. 'Newark in 2012' is used as an example to reinforce this stereotype, implying that the problems in Newark are due to the actions of black people. 'The predictable result of freedom' suggests that giving freedom to black people leads to negative outcomes, which is a derogatory and stereotypical implication."
16510,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and mockery to downplay the existence of violent white nationalists, which can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice by dismissing concerns about a serious issue.

20710,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language to convey a negative and discriminatory attitude towards Muslims. It implies that Muslims and their places of worship are unwanted and should be removed from the community. The term 'extreme Islamic' can be interpreted as a coded phrase that generalizes and stigmatizes Muslims, suggesting that they are all extremists. The demand to shut down mosques implies that these places of worship are seen as threats or unwanted elements in the community. The overall tone and language suggest an underlying bias and hostility towards Muslims, using the community's voice ('we the people') to legitimize these discriminatory views."
3353,not_hate,0.95,"The text critiques or supports the idea of police autonomy without any reference to race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.

The term 'illegals' is often used to dehumanize and stigmatize undocumented immigrants, reducing them to their legal status rather than recognizing their humanity. The phrase 'save your tax dollars' implies that undocumented immigrants are a financial burden, further stigmatizing them. The call for deportation suggests that the solution to this perceived problem is to remove these individuals from the country.

11817,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text juxtaposes the fact that Bernile Nienau is Jewish with her connection to Adolf Hitler, who is known for his anti-Semitic views.

6980,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses euphemistic language to disguise support for white nationalists, which is a form of implicit hate speech.

1343,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses sarcasm and contrasts support for organizations like the NAACP and CBC with the denial of the right to organize for white people. This can be interpreted as promoting the idea that white people should have the same rights to organize as other groups, potentially with an underlying tone of white supremacy. The use of 'great' in a sarcastic tone and the overall message could be seen as advocating for white people's rights in a way that suggests a belief in white supremacy or entitlement."
20081,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses ethnic and religious labels in a way that generalizes individuals based on their perceived characteristics. This reductive labeling is likely intended to be offensive and derogatory, aligning with the category of implicit hate speech.

1390,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote a conspiratorial narrative about an 'anti-white crackdown,' which is intended to provoke and divide by suggesting a systematic bias against white people.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and sarcasm to convey prejudicial attitudes."
16791,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'americansupremist' suggests a belief in the superiority of Americans, which is inherently discriminatory.

This combination aligns with stereotyping and dehumanization, which are key features of implicit hate speech."
21181,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text is a joke that dehumanizes individuals who use wheelchairs by comparing them to vegetables. The joke sets up a question about vegetables, which are inanimate objects, and the punchline reveals that the answer is 'the wheelchair,' implying that a person in a wheelchair is like a vegetable. This comparison dehumanizes the person by reducing them to an object, specifically a vegetable, which is a form of implicit abuse. The humor relies on the degrading comparison, making it an abusive statement disguised as a joke."

17825,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'elder you're a bit insane.' can be interpreted as a playful or humorous remark, intended to tease the person rather than seriously accuse them of being insane. The phrase 'a bit insane' could be seen as a light-hearted way to point out eccentric behavior, and the context in which the statement is made could be casual or friendly, suggesting a teasing tone. The use of 'elder' might be a playful way to address someone older or more experienced, adding to the humorous intent.

The prediction of disappointment implies that their political agency will not result in meaningful change. The absurd example of 'rights for three legged, gay martians' can be seen as a coded way to dismiss African American concerns as trivial. The mention of 'white, rich leftist stockholders in the northeast' reinforces the implicit bias by suggesting that the interests of privileged groups are prioritized."
81,not_hate,1.0,"The text 'today is national horse protection day! please sign and share our petition -->' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a straightforward call to action for animal welfare, specifically horse protection, and does not target any protected categories with abuse or prejudice."
21140,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to the Holocaust, a historical event where a protected category was the primary target. The humor derived from the shock value and the taboo nature of the subject matter is implicitly abusive and provocative. The text is designed to disguise its offensive intent through indirect language, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
2922,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses the term 'normies' in a pejorative way to describe mainstream or conventional people, implying a dismissive and derogatory attitude towards them. This suggests that these individuals are less important or less worthy of attention, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against a perceived out-group. The focus on 'people on the fence' reinforces the idea that undecided individuals are more valuable, further marginalizing the 'normies'."
7388,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily expresses the speaker's frustration and confusion due to being labeled with derogatory terms by different groups. While it mentions derogatory labels, it does not promote prejudice or use coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes. Instead, it highlights the speaker's bewilderment and sense of being unfairly targeted."
13587,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and derogatory hashtags such as '#cuckservative' and '#illegalaliens' which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against immigrants and conservatives. The hashtag '#illegalaliens' dehumanizes undocumented immigrants, and '#cuckservative' is a derogatory term often used to insult conservatives. These elements suggest implicit hate speech."
18093,implicit_hate,0.85,"The use of the term 'cuck' is a coded reference to gender stereotypes and misogyny, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The context of the text, which discusses political stances and perceived weaknesses or inconsistencies, supports this interpretation."
9245,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly reinforces stereotypes about women being weaker or less capable than men, despite the sarcastic tone. The sarcastic statement 'yeah . women are people believe it or not' can be seen as a backhanded compliment, implying that some people might not believe women are equal. The phrase 'if they punch they get punched back' can be interpreted as a subtle suggestion that women should not initiate physical conflict because they will face consequences. The sarcastic remark 'unless you think they're unequal to men somehow ...' reinforces the stereotype that women are weaker or less capable than men, despite the sarcastic tone."
21060,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly states that white people have a 'pleasant scent,' which is a positive attribute. It then suggests that this scent is necessary for blind people to distinguish white people from animals. By implication, non-white people are being likened to animals, which is a form of dehumanization. This interpretation is supported by the analysis that identifies the subtype of implicit abuse as dehumanization."
3213,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses stereotypes about Jewish people and white nationalists to create a divisive narrative, implying that the recipient is being manipulated by these stereotypes. The phrase 'he chose the Jewish people over white nationalists' generalizes and implies stereotypes about these groups, which is a form of implicit abuse under the subtype of Stereotypes. The manipulation implied by 'has played you like a fiddle' could be interpreted as the recipient being influenced by these stereotypes. The taunt 'how do you like it' adds a layer of mockery, suggesting the recipient is being ridiculed for falling for these stereotypes."
2041,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to Nazism, which is a historical reference to a violent and hateful ideology targeting protected categories. The sarcastic and provocative tone, along with the use of irony, suggests an implicit promotion of prejudice. The phrase 'national socialist organization' is a euphemism for a Nazi-like group, which is universally recognized as negative and associated with hateful ideologies."
9380,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text '#charlottesville a day that will go down in white history' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language ('white history') that indirectly celebrates or endorses the white supremacist ideology associated with the Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' rally. This rally was marked by violent clashes and the death of a counter-protester, Heather Heyer. The phrase 'white history' suggests a perspective that supports the white supremacist narrative, making it implicit hate speech."
3384,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'more than 10000 people are evacuated across Moscow after bomb threats' is a straightforward news report about a significant event. It provides a clear and concise description of an evacuation due to bomb threats, with neutral and factual language typical of news reporting.

4805,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'dhs backpedals on gay spouse green cards' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The term 'backpedals' can be interpreted as criticism of policy reversal, neutral reporting, political commentary on immigration policy, or highlighting bureaucratic incompetence. None of these interpretations suggest implicit hate speech."
14719,not_hate,0.85,"The text critiques systemic privileges enjoyed by white people, suggesting that their achievements are facilitated by societal advantages rather than individual merit. The phrase 'unearned privileges' and the mention of 'white society' indicate a broader critique of societal frameworks that benefit white people. This interpretation does not promote prejudice but rather highlights societal inequalities."
821,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey a sense of victimization and blame directed towards a protected category (black people). The phrase 'anti-white hate' suggests a perception of hostility directed towards white people, and 'to blame for black fai' indicates that white people are being held responsible for the failures or issues of black people. This aligns with the concept of racial scapegoating, where one group is blamed for the problems of another group, promoting prejudice indirectly."
2429,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily discusses political strategies and public perception without directly or indirectly targeting any protected categories. The term 'aggressive' is used in a political context rather than to promote prejudice or dehumanize any group. The reference to Gujarat does not explicitly or implicitly invoke hateful references, incitement, slurs, tropes, dehumanization, or hateful imagery."
20874,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reinforces negative stereotypes about Muslims by associating them with violence and terrorism. The phrase 'Allahu Akbar' is often misused in media and popular culture to stereotype Muslims as violent or terrorists. The text describes a bearded man shouting 'Allahu Akbar' while committing a violent act (killing four people), implicitly suggesting that Muslims are perpetrators of such acts. The lack of additional context or background further emphasizes the stereotype."
19117,not_hate,0.95,"The text uses metaphorical language to describe negative traits of an individual, but it does not target any protected category based on race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. The insults are general and not directed at any specific group, making it not implicit hate speech."
11356,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that promote the idea of white superiority. The phrase 'living in a white society is best' explicitly states a preference for white societies, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against non-white societies. The use of 'cause' suggests a causal relationship, implying inherent advantages to living in a white society. The statement 'i don't think i meet the requirements for but i support them' indicates endorsement of white superiority despite not fitting certain criteria, possibly racial or cultural."
13166,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'attn : all white people : here's your wake up call >' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but the most consistent reasoning paths suggest that it is a call to social awareness, an urgent appeal for change, a provocation for reflection, a general announcement, or an activist message. These interpretations do not necessarily imply abuse or prejudice but rather a strong call to action or awareness. The term 'wake up call' is often used to urge awareness or action without conveying prejudicial attitudes."
9866,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a straightforward, factual report of an event. It states a specific number of individuals ('over 250') and their nationality ('Swedish'). It identifies the group as 'white nationalists' and specifies the location of the event ('Stockholm'). It includes a reference to a video, suggesting it is a news report or a factual account.

2808,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies a derogatory attitude towards people who receive food stamps, suggesting they are a burden on society. The phrase 'jail them' suggests a punitive action against a group of people, and the comparison of the cost of jailing them to the cost of their food stamps suggests that the speaker views these individuals as a financial burden on taxpayers. The overall tone is dismissive and derogatory, implying that these individuals are not worthy of the support they receive and are better off being incarcerated."
21277,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses a common joke format to stereotype feminists as ineffective and incapable of bringing about change. This aligns with the stereotype that feminists are incompetent, which is a common prejudicial belief. The humor element can make the stereotype more palatable and less likely to be challenged. Additionally, the text can be seen as an abusive statement disguised as humor, intended to insult feminists by suggesting they are incompetent."
7121,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'cuck' is a derogatory slang term often used to compare someone to a cuckold, implying weakness or lack of masculinity. The phrase 'nothing childish about jealousy' can be seen as sarcastic, implying that jealousy is indeed childish. Combining these elements, the text could be interpreted as a dismissive insult, suggesting that the target's jealousy is not childish but rather a sign of their weakness or submissiveness. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes."
11805,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'the #trucons are getting blown out tonight. looks like it will be over 50 % across the board' can be interpreted in multiple neutral contexts such as political commentary, sports commentary, social media trends, financial market commentary, or gaming/esports commentary.

The term '#trucons' does not inherently target any protected category, and the language used is straightforward and neutral."
1471,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against Jewish people and immigrants. The term 'jew activist' is used in a derogatory manner, and the phrase 'destroy Europe via non-white immigration' suggests a negative impact on Europe, aligning with xenophobic views. This combination implies a conspiracy theory that Jewish people are responsible for negative societal changes, a common trope in anti-Semitic propaganda."
19973,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'keep kicking and braying for me donkey!' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses dehumanizing language by likening the recipient to a donkey, which is often used as a derogatory term to imply stupidity or stubbornness.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
3845,not_hate,0.95,"The text '#scotus declined to take case related to certain #plannedparenthood grant docs kept secret by #obama administration' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

The use of hashtags and the mention of 'kept secret' do not imply any prejudicial attitudes towards any protected categories."
3905,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to undermine the credibility of the media, which can be seen as a protected category under the umbrella of 'profession.' The phrase 'pitting the people against' implies an active effort to create animosity, and 'fake news media' is a derogatory term that aims to undermine the credibility of journalists and media outlets.

This fits the criteria of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
12810,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes a stereotype about white Americans, suggesting that they are commonly disliked by 'wakefield' and possibly others. The phrase 'nothing new' implies that this dislike is a common or expected attitude, which can be interpreted as a stereotype. This interpretation fits the description of stereotypes, which are generalized beliefs about groups of people, and aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech."
1083,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily reports events in a factual manner without explicit bias or judgment. It mentions a legal decision and specific actions without emotive language, suggesting a neutral tone. The lack of coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes indicates that it is not implicit hate speech."
1236,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses a flippant and dismissive tone to describe a tragic event, which can be seen as dehumanizing and lacking empathy. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it indirectly promotes prejudicial attitudes through coded language and stereotypes."
9402,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text suggests a conspiracy theory where the KKK is secretly collaborating with federal authorities. This interpretation can be seen as promoting prejudice and mistrust towards federal authorities and the KKK, which are both sensitive and controversial topics. The use of 'lol' can be seen as a way to soften the blow of a serious accusation, making it seem more like a joke but still hinting at a deeper, conspiratorial belief. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
20875,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains a direct and explicit statement wishing harm to a specific group (white kids), which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The statement is presented without any clear indication of humor or satire, which could be interpreted as a genuine call for action. This interpretation is the most consistent with the guidelines for identifying implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
18491,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against Muslims. The phrase 'jihad against Europeans' is provocative and suggests a collective threat from Muslims.

2765,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to promote prejudice against black people.

14452,not_hate,0.85,"The text is a political commentary highlighting a perceived bias or oversight in Obama's Middle East policy. The phrase 'erases Israeli territory' could be interpreted as a metaphorical way of saying that Obama's policies do not adequately recognize or support Israel's territorial integrity. This interpretation fits into the category of Other Implicit Abuse, where the statement relies on cultural and political knowledge to imply that Obama's actions are harmful or disrespectful to Israel, but it does not target individuals or groups with abuse based on their protected characteristics."
16464,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies that only 'white America' can save the economy, thereby excluding and devaluing the contributions of non-white populations and immigrants. The phrase 'white America' is singled out as the group that needs to 'step up' and have more kids, suggesting that the economic stability of the country depends on the reproductive choices of white people. The mention of DACA in a negative context ('w / o daca') implies that immigrants are not seen as a viable solution to the economic problem. This interpretation requires cultural and social knowledge to understand the underlying abusive implications."
5403,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies that members of Antifa are unemployed or socially marginalized, suggesting that they are already in a position where they cannot suffer further social or employment consequences. This is a derogatory and dismissive comment aimed at belittling Antifa members. The phrase 'they can't really suffer social or employment consequences' suggests that Antifa members are already in a marginalized social or employment status, which aligns with the cultural and social knowledge that being unemployed or socially marginalized is often seen as a negative condition. The text uses this implied status to dismiss the impact of doxing on Antifa members, implying that they are already in a low position and thus cannot be further harmed."
15796,implicit_hate,0.75,"The term 'freaks' could be interpreted as derogatory or dismissive, suggesting a lack of respect or understanding towards the Jewish community's sensitivity regarding the Holocaust. The mention of Siegfried Verbeke, a known Holocaust denier, adds to the implicit abusive nature. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the text is dismissive of the Jewish community's feelings and the significance of the Holocaust."
12057,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote a harmful and prejudicial narrative against Jewish people. The phrase 'anti-white agenda perpetrated by the jews' is a clear example of misinformation and a harmful stereotype, intended to harass and dehumanize Jewish people. The use of the hashtag '#blacktwitter' adds contextual layers that suggest an attempt to engage with a specific audience to spread this narrative."
17918,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text stereotypes liberals and BLM supporters by suggesting they would dislike 'White Christmas' due to its title containing the word 'white.' This generalization and stereotyping are forms of implicit hate speech, as they promote prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
1618,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to criticize and condemn the person's openness about their white supremacist views. The juxtaposition of 'refreshing' with 'white supremacy' creates a stark contrast, indicating that the speaker is not genuinely praising the openness but rather criticizing it. This indirectly highlights the absurdity and negativity of white supremacy, which is a form of implicit hate speech."
1169,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates a negative stereotype about African immigrants by portraying them as threatening and dangerous. The emotionally charged language and the deliberate contrast between the African immigrant and the native Italian woman suggest an intent to incite fear and mistrust towards immigrants, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
783,not_hate,0.85,"The text is primarily a critique of racism and the alt-right, highlighting the hypocrisy within certain Christian communities. While it uses strong language, it does not promote prejudice but rather calls out racist behavior. The text does not use coded language or abstract references to promote prejudice but instead directly addresses and criticizes racist attitudes."
17863,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'he is not white he is a jew' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The statement contrasts 'white' with 'jew,' which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and imply inferiority.

9960,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'success in ar lawsuit against opp | american renaissance' can be interpreted as celebrating a legal victory for American Renaissance, a publication known for promoting white nationalist views. This interpretation suggests a reinforcement of their ideologies, which are often associated with prejudice against protected categories. The coded language and abstract references to legal success against opponents or opposition to their views align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
17827,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies that immigrants or non-native-born individuals do not belong and are not entitled to the same rights and benefits as those who consider themselves 'rightful heirs.' The phrase 'ending daca is a step in the right direction' suggests a negative stance towards the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provides temporary protection from deportation for eligible undocumented immigrants. The statement 'we are the rightful heirs to what our ancestors built' implies a sense of entitlement and exclusion. Combining these two statements suggests that the speaker believes certain groups (likely immigrants or non-native-born individuals) are not entitled to the benefits and rights that 'rightful heirs' (presumably native-born individuals) deserve. This interpretation requires cultural and contextual knowledge to understand the underlying xenophobic or exclusionary sentiment."
17525,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial tension and misinformation. It associates a high-profile political figure with a racially motivated crime, which is a highly inflammatory topic. The incomplete nature of the message ('via') suggests further speculation or misinformation, aiming to stir up racial and political animosity. The goal could be to incite fear, spread false information, or provoke strong emotional reactions."
15986,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language ('future dim voters') which could be a euphemistic way of referring to a racial or ethnic minority. The phrase 'we know who he sides with' suggests that this group is being singled out as problematic, and 'over own citizens' implies that the author believes this group is being favored at the expense of the majority population. The strong emotional and critical tone reinforces the author's disapproval and suggests that this bias is shared by the political establishment."
387,not_hate,0.9,"The text expresses disbelief and defense towards an accusation of racism, rather than promoting prejudice or using coded language to convey hate. The tone is dismissive and incredulous, suggesting that the speaker finds the accusation unfounded."
11562,implicit_hate,0.75,"The statement 'i see nothing wrong with pride in ones white race' can be seen as a justification for white pride, which is often associated with white supremacist ideologies. The listing of 'blacks mexicans jews' without any context or positive affirmation can be interpreted as a way to 'other' these groups, suggesting they are different and possibly inferior. The incomplete sentence 'all are' could be interpreted as 'all are inferior' or 'all are problematic,' reinforcing negative stereotypes."
19651,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'edumacated' is a deliberate misspelling of 'educated,' often used in a derogatory manner. The phrase 'how will blacks become edumacated ?!' suggests a stereotype that Black people are not capable of achieving education. The use of the exclamation mark adds an emotional tone, emphasizing the speaker's disbelief or mockery. This interpretation aligns with the analysis of implicit abuse through euphemistic constructions and other implicit abuse categories."
7009,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language to express frustration with policies that are seen as disadvantaging white people. The phrase 'it's ok to be white' is a loaded statement that has been used in various contexts to discuss racial issues. The condition 'as long as you're also fine with anti-white policies that displace whites' is a form of coded language that implies frustration with these policies. The use of 'inb 4' suggests the speaker is anticipating a backlash, indicating they are aware of the sensitive nature of the topic. The text requires an understanding of current social and political debates to fully grasp the speaker's frustration, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
3631,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to express fear and anxiety about the future of white people in Europe due to multiculturalism. The rhetorical question 'what happens when there are no more white people in europe ?' and the statement 'try saying muticulti is good for any other race' imply that multiculturalism is harmful to white people, promoting prejudicial attitudes without using explicit hate language."
20050,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory stereotypes about gender and sexual orientation to create an insult. The phrase 'dude looks like a lesbian butch' is a negative comparison involving an offensive analogy, and the question 'how do we know that's a man?' suggests doubt about the person's gender, implying that they do not conform to traditional masculine norms. This combination indicates that the statement is meant to be humorous at the expense of the person being described, using stereotypes to create an insult. Additionally, the text can be seen as a personal attack aimed at demeaning and belittling the person being described."
8389,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text implicitly attributes negative acts (terrorism) to a specific identity group (white supremacists), despite the sarcastic tone. The underlying message still conveys that white supremacists are responsible for crimes or immoral acts. The sarcastic tone could be a way to soften the accusation while still conveying the negative attribution."
12896,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reflects a personal bias that uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'evil white people' is a clear example of a negative stereotype, and the focus on the positive aspects of non-white people suggests a positive bias towards them. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
14990,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey a negative stereotype about the Hispanic population in California, implying that their demographic shift is causing instability or disunity by wanting to secede. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it promotes prejudice without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
13839,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that caring about white lives is being unfairly labeled as racist. This indirectly promotes a prejudicial attitude by implying that the recipient is biased against white people. The phrase 'that says a lot about you' adds a layer of judgment and provocation, which can be seen as inciting fear or spreading fearful stereotypes."
12114,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes the beliefs and actions of liberals, attributing a specific belief or action to an entire group based on the stereotype of 'white privilege.' By attributing this stereotype to all liberals, the text implies that liberals are uniformly supportive of an extreme and controversial idea, which can be seen as a form of implicit abuse."
18828,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and an absurd scenario to provoke a reaction from liberals, which can be seen as promoting prejudice through coded language and stereotypes. The hashtag '#liberallogic' targets liberals specifically, and the phrase 'must mean he's a racist' is designed to be inflammatory. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
17772,not_hate,0.95,"The most consistent reasoning is that the text is acknowledging authorship, endorsement, quality, satisfaction, ownership, or commitment. None of these interpretations involve coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect promotion of prejudice against any protected category."
13914,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes a group ('alt-right nordic warrior anti-semite' 'trump subset') by attributing a specific characteristic ('they're obsessed with homosexual practice and technique'). This generalization is a form of stereotyping, which is a subtype of implicit abuse. The statement relies on cultural and social knowledge to interpret the derogatory implications, making it a subtle and coded insult."
14513,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques societal beauty standards that prioritize lighter skin tones, which is a commentary on societal norms rather than an attack on any protected category. The use of 'sadly' indicates disapproval of the trend, not promotion of prejudice."
15945,not_hate,0.95,"The text explicitly rejects the notion that one group's life is more expendable than another, emphasizing equality and critiquing discriminatory attitudes. The use of exaggerated language and the context of 'killing' serve to highlight the absurdity of prejudiced views and advocate for equal protection from violence. The text does not promote prejudice but rather challenges it."
1007,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It critiques elitism and intellectual pretension rather than targeting any protected category."
7995,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to immigrants, suggesting a negative connotation. The use of '#swrm' (which could be interpreted as 'swarm') and '#immigrants' suggests a negative attitude towards immigrants. The sarcastic tone in 'only 68 % ! ?' and 'id check again !' implies that the speaker finds the percentage surprisingly low and believes it should be higher, reinforcing a negative stereotype about immigrants being on welfare."
658,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward, neutral description of a scene where media personnel are waiting for the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) arguments related to Proposition 8 (#prop8) and marriage equality (#marriagematters) to conclude. The text uses neutral language and does not contain any derogatory or abusive terms. The hashtags #prop8 and #marriagematters are commonly used to refer to the legal and social issues surrounding Proposition 8 and marriage equality. The phrase 'media waiting for #scotus arguments to end' suggests a journalistic context, where reporters are covering an important legal event."
3717,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses hashtags like #stopislam and #stopsharia, which indicate a negative stance towards Islam and Sharia law. The phrase 'warns the civilizef world about dangers of #islam' suggests that the author believes Islam poses a threat. The statement 'yet can't enter uk bcse he warns' implies that the person is being silenced for their views. This interpretation aligns with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' where the text implies a derogatory attitude towards a specific religious group."
15493,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'the ongoing war against white people : european front' uses coded language and abstract references to convey a message of hostility and fear. The phrase 'ongoing war' suggests a persistent and organized effort, and the specification of 'white people' as the target group indicates directed animosity. The inclusion of 'European front' suggests a geographical focus, implying a coordinated effort or movement. The overall tone and language can be interpreted as inciting or encouraging actions against the specified group, promoting a conspiracy theory, expressing racial animosity, instilling fear, and serving as political propaganda. These elements align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
19451,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text relies on cultural and social knowledge to convey its harmful implications, suggesting a desire for the extinction of a specific racial group and their replacement with another group, which is both racist and dehumanizing. The derogatory term 'low-iq slave workers' relies on cultural and social stereotypes to convey a dehumanizing message. The overall message is implicitly abusive, as it requires the reader to understand the cultural context to fully grasp the harmful intent."
15561,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the hashtag '#whitegenocide,' which is a coded reference to a conspiracy theory suggesting that white people are being systematically replaced or eliminated. This is an abstract reference to race and promotes prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. The positive sentiment expressed towards 'nationalists' who oppose this perceived threat implies support for racist and xenophobic ideologies."
18705,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'here's an intriguing piece by on the #altright and southern' is incomplete and lacks explicit or implicit abusive language or intent. The most consistent reasoning paths suggest that the text is either sharing information, introducing a critical analysis, or part of an academic report. There is no clear evidence of coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
11382,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly mentions 'white on white rape,' which identifies a specific racial group as perpetrators. This aligns with the subtype of 'Perpetrators' where a specific identity group is depicted as responsible for a crime. The use of the term 'astronomical' further emphasizes the severity and prevalence of the issue within this group, which can be seen as promoting racial bias and stereotyping."
20961,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'What do bikes and black men have in common? The chain' uses coded language and abstract references to dehumanize and stereotype black men. The comparison to bikes and the use of 'chain' evoke historical and contemporary connotations of slavery and imprisonment, which are dehumanizing and perpetuate harmful racial stereotypes. The text is also structured as a derogatory joke, relying on an offensive comparison to elicit humor at the expense of black men. This combination of dehumanization, racial stereotyping, and derogatory humor makes the text implicit hate speech."
20716,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcastic language to convey a strong disagreement with allowing a group, likely immigrants or refugees, to come and live freely at the expense of others. The sarcastic tone and the phrase 'we foot the bill' imply a financial burden and a perceived entitlement of the group, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against them. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey a prejudicial attitude."
13383,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a straightforward condemnation of the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, specifically referring to the Unite the Right rally in 2017. The phrase 'indisputable facts' suggests that the violence is well-documented and undeniable. 'They perpetuated' indicates that a specific group is being held responsible for the violence. The context of Charlottesville in 2017 is well-known for the Unite the Right rally, which involved white supremacists and resulted in significant violence and the death of a counter-protester. The text does not use any language that could be construed as abusive; instead, it is a factual statement and criticism of the perpetrators."
16697,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against extremist Jews by accusing them of heinous crimes. The phrase 'muslim fakes hate attack by extremist jews' dismisses legitimate concerns about hate crimes, and the question 'what about the real ones who kill babies?' is an inflammatory claim intended to stir up emotions and possibly actions against the accused group."
5258,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language to deny racial motivations for disliking Obama and instead frames the dislike as purely political. It suggests that white southerners' disapproval of Obama is based on his perceived anti-American stance rather than his race. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse where a specific identity group (white southerners) is depicted as responsible for a negative act (despising someone because they are perceived as anti-American). The statement uses coded language to convey a derogatory message, implying that Obama is unpatriotic, which is a divisive and abusive statement."
1285,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text references David Duke, a well-known white supremacist figure, as the 'white man's champion,' which suggests a positive view of his ideologies. The phrase 'the white race is dying a face death' metaphorically likens the white race to an entity that is dying, which is a form of dehumanization. The idea that the white race is in decline and facing extinction is a common trope in white supremacist rhetoric, often used to incite fear and action. The coded language and abstract references to the decline of the white race align with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
17994,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly states that white pride is not acceptable, which perpetuates a stereotype about the acceptability of racial pride based on race. This can be interpreted as a form of coded racism, where the underlying message is that white people should not express pride in their race."
13229,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'elect officials that will separate from EU and support the people' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected categories.

14710,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text implies that being Haitian is associated with certain stereotypes or characteristics that a white person would not possess. The phrase 'white guy' is juxtaposed with 'Haitian,' suggesting an inherent difference or incompatibility between the two. The exclamation mark at the end adds emphasis, which could be interpreted as a derogatory tone, implying that being Haitian is somehow inferior or associated with negative stereotypes."
13448,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to criticize religion, which is a protected characteristic. Phrases like 'stupid religion,' 'disease of the mind,' and 'breeds hate and stupidity' convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs.

263,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a straightforward report of the Southern Poverty Law Center's classification of a group as a hate group due to their stance against immigration, except for white Western Europeans. It does not contain any derogatory language or stereotypes; it simply reports the SPLC's classification."
9337,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that a societal collapse would lead to a rise in white supremacy or white nationalism. The phrase 'resurgence in white identity' implies a strengthening or re-emergence of white identity in the context of a significant societal disruption. The hashtags '#tcot' and '#race' indicate a discussion within conservative politics and race, which can be interpreted as suggesting that a societal collapse would benefit white supremacist or nationalist ideologies."
8576,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text makes a negative comparison involving an offensive analogy, suggesting that white supremacists have done something positive, which is inherently offensive and abusive. This interpretation is the most consistent because it directly aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
19813,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'snowflake' is commonly used as a derogatory comparison to imply that someone is overly sensitive or easily offended. The phrase 'melting in the snowlol!!' adds a mocking tone, suggesting that the person is weak or fragile. The use of 'lol' indicates an attempt to disguise the insult as humor. The overall tone and context suggest that the text is meant to belittle and mock the person, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and stereotypes."
17801,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'cultural Marxism' is often used derogatorily to describe progressive movements and is frequently associated with conspiracy theories. The phrase 'at work' suggests that these movements are actively engaged in subversive activity, implying a negative view and a belief in a covert agenda. This coded language and abstract references promote prejudice against progressive ideologies and their supporters, which can be classified as implicit hate speech."
6372,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against white individuals. The terms 'radical apologist' and 'racist against anyone white' are indirect ways of conveying negative stereotypes and biases. The language is emotionally charged and polarizing, aiming to discredit Van Jones and manipulate public opinion."
8394,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text defends the idea that it is not supremacist for white people to want to maintain their own countries, which can be interpreted as promoting exclusionary sentiments and reinforcing nationalistic ideals that may be perceived as racist or discriminatory.

3818,not_hate,0.95,"The text describes an educational initiative where William Clark is speaking with students about race and identity. The school has encouraged white people to engage in some form of action related to these topics. There is no coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

12878,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'white pride' is often used as a euphemism for promoting white supremacy, which is an ideology that asserts the superiority of the white race over other races. This interpretation is supported by the historical and cultural context in which 'white pride' has been used to disguise racist sentiments."
19435,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text explicitly labels Islam as 'evil' and declares a '100% islam free zone,' which implicitly targets Muslims by creating an exclusionary and hostile environment. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against a protected category."
18458,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reflects internalized racism, where the speaker is projecting their own self-loathing onto a specific group of 'white people' who they perceive as inferior. The use of 'lower' and the incomplete phrase 'establis' suggests a sense of superiority or disdain towards this group. The phrase 'you don't hate yourself' implies that the speaker is addressing someone who is experiencing self-loathing, and the shift to 'you hate the 'lower' 'white people'' suggests that the speaker is projecting this self-loathing onto an external group. The incomplete phrase 'establis' could be interpreted as 'establishment' or 'established norms,' indicating that the speaker feels these 'white people' do not uphold certain values or standards, reflecting internalized racism."
14371,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a critique of the alt-right, holding them accountable for the actions of Trump, which the author may view as negative. This interpretation suggests that the author has a negative view of Trump's actions and, by extension, the alt-right. However, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. It is a political statement rather than implicit hate speech."
558,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'keep debating optics guys . keep arguing over the really really important' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The various interpretations (Sarcasm, Frustration, Encouragement, Irony, Resignation, Humor) do not suggest any form of implicit hate speech. The text is more likely a commentary on the perceived triviality or importance of a debate, rather than an attack on any protected category."
254,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against women and white people. The phrase 'whores of babylon' is a derogatory term often used to insult and demean women, suggesting a misogynistic intent. The hashtags '#whitegenocide' and '#waronwhites' suggest a call for harmful actions against white people, indicating a racist intent. The mention of 'Lena Dunham celebrates white genocide' implies that Lena Dunham is being accused of supporting or celebrating the decline of the white race, which is a highly inflammatory and racist narrative."
2427,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains a direct threat ('milo might wind up in a body bag') and a call to action for a specific group (Antifa) to take harmful actions against Milo. The mention of 'cent . com for the antifa army' suggests organizing or coordinating harmful actions. The rhetorical question 'who is advising him?' adds to the abusive nature by criticizing Milo's advisors, implying they are incompetent or harmful. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and indirect references to promote prejudice and incite fear."
11509,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses stereotypes to objectify and generalize a group of people ('bruvuhs') and their supposed preferences for a certain type of woman ('beefy white woman'). The term 'beefy white woman' is derogatory and objectifies women based on their physical appearance. The overall tone suggests a disparaging attitude towards both the group being stereotyped and the women being objectified.
11411,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'dead baby jokes at planned parenthood' is a highly controversial statement that implies Planned Parenthood is associated with the death of babies. This can be seen as an abstract reference to a protected category (pregnancy and reproductive health) and promotes prejudice against the organization and its services. The statement 'not funny' and the demand 'give us back our tax' reinforce a negative stereotype and call for action against the organization, which can be interpreted as inciting fear and spreading negative stereotypes."
20451,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses the term 'illegals' which is often considered derogatory and dehumanizing. It emphasizes the criminality of undocumented immigrants by labeling them as lawbreakers and comparing them unfavorably to legal immigrants.

15919,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text associates Hillary Clinton with the KKK, a group known for its racist and extremist views, and uses the hashtag '#altright,' which is associated with promoting racist and extremist views. This indirectly promotes prejudice against protected categories through misinformation and coded language."
12925,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'white power' is a well-known slogan associated with white supremacist ideologies. The use of 'you go guys' in conjunction with 'white power' suggests encouragement and support for white supremacist actions.

The combination of these phrases can be interpreted as a call to action, urging individuals to engage in activities that promote white supremacy."
7537,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses sarcasm, irony, and euphemistic language to convey a negative message about Islam, implying that it is not peaceful. This indirect and coded language fits the criteria for implicit hate speech, as it promotes prejudice without using explicit hate language."
43,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes the 'freedom from religion group' as 'such troublemakers,' which is a form of stereotyping that applies a negative label to the entire group.

13001,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text highlights a generalized stereotype about Muslims being associated with anti-Jewish hate. The phrase 'nothing to do with islam' suggests a generalized belief about Muslims, and the context of 'rt more anti-jew hate' indicates that the speaker is pointing out a perceived connection between anti-Jewish sentiment and Islam. This aligns with the idea that the speaker is perpetuating a stereotype about Muslims, which is a form of implicit hate speech."
12067,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'thug' in a racially charged manner, implying that black-on-black crime is a significant issue that the 'Black Lives Matter' movement ignores.

12352,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies that white southerners are essential for the success of any cause related to 'white existence,' suggesting a sense of racial superiority and division. The phrase 'without us white southerners' suggests that white southerners are indispensable, and the challenge 'see how far you get' implies that without white southerners, the cause will fail. This can be interpreted as a derogatory attitude towards non-white southerners, implying they are less capable or important. The overall tone suggests a divisive and racist mindset, where the success of a cause is dependent on a specific racial group."
15623,not_hate,0.85,"While the statement 'white people take more from the system than any other group' can be interpreted as a generalization and stereotyping, it does not contain coded language, abstract references, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

The context and multiple interpretations suggest that the statement is not intended to promote prejudice but rather to highlight disparities."
6351,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text depicts Muslims as the primary perpetrators of hatred towards other religious groups, including other Muslims who do not conform to their beliefs.

20263,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses phrases like 'throw them out,' 'turn them back,' and 'return them,' which are commonly associated with deportation or forced removal. The urgency implied by 'now' and the determination in 'whatever it takes' suggests a strong desire to take immediate and forceful action.

The dehumanizing tone and the call for action align with the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action.'"
11406,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the derogatory term 'cucks' to stereotype and belittle individuals who support left-wing politics, reinforcing the stereotype of weakness.

The use of 'a jewish minority' without further context or qualification supports the idea of stereotyping."
7701,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a straightforward report on a political situation where the British government is taking action against a controversial group. It does not contain any abusive language but rather reports on a controversial group and the government's response.

799,not_hate,0.95,The text is advocating for immigrants by pointing out that a small number of incidents should not be used to generalize or stigmatize the entire immigrant population. The emphasis on 'two whole examples' and '11 mil immigrants' underscores the rarity of such incidents. The sarcastic tone and the phrase 'stop being so afraid' imply that the speaker is defending immigrants against unfair generalizations. The overall message suggests that immigrants should not be judged based on a few isolated incidents.
17271,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory language and stereotypes to describe specific cultural and political groups, which can be seen as promoting prejudice indirectly.

19699,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses dehumanizing language ('feral bastards') to describe individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, which is a coded way of promoting prejudice against the poor. The contrast between 'well off family' and 'feral bastards' suggests a class struggle where the wealthy view the poor as a dangerous and uncontrollable force, reinforcing negative stereotypes."
13488,not_hate,0.9,"The text states that there is no significant difference in intelligence between white women, white men, black men, and black women. By asserting that no group is 'closer' in intelligence to another, the text promotes the idea of equal intelligence across these groups. The goal is to reinforce the concept of equality and dispel any notions of superiority based on race or gender."
7909,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text generalizes the behavior and moral judgment of actions based on race, reinforcing stereotypes. The statement suggests that actions are only considered evil when performed by white people, which reinforces a stereotypical belief that white people are more likely to be judged negatively for their actions. This generalization implies an implicit bias against white people, suggesting that their actions are inherently more evil."
14624,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to paint a picture of a mayor who is not only incompetent but also actively involved in causing harm through riots. The phrase 'has the blood of one of his' is used to create a sense of fear and distrust towards the mayor, fitting the subtype of 'Perpetrators,' where a specific group and individual are framed as responsible for immoral acts to spread misinformation. This aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, including misinformation and appeals to prejudicial attitudes without explicit language."
2758,implicit_hate,0.9,"The phrase 'white homeland in every state' can be interpreted as a call for racial segregation, which is inherently discriminatory and harmful. It aligns with historical and contemporary calls for racial segregation and white supremacist rhetoric. Even if interpreted as a metaphorical expression of white pride or a misguided attempt at cultural preservation, it still carries implicit abusive undertones by excluding non-white individuals. The satirical interpretation is less likely given the context and historical usage of such phrases."
13043,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a social media commentary using hashtags to make a sarcastic remark about the perceived honesty of Varun Gandhi and Kumar Vishwas.

10340,not_hate,0.95,"The text aims to evoke an emotional response from readers, particularly those who may be opposed to abortion or government funding of it. The phrase 'force taxpayers to pay for abortions' is emotionally charged and likely to provoke strong reactions. The question 'will yours in 2017?' adds a sense of urgency and personal relevance, making the issue feel more immediate. The hashtag '#obamacare' helps to focus the emotional appeal on a specific policy, making it more targeted and impactful. However, the text does not target any protected category based on race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.

The phrase 'why hindus should boycott' implies a division between Hindus and the target group. The label 'anti hindu outfit' reinforces this division by portraying the target group as inherently opposed to Hindus.

20535,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'hire more border guards. turn them back!' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its coded language and abstract references that convey prejudicial attitudes towards immigrants or refugees. The directive to 'turn them back' implies exclusion and hostility, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The context suggests a negative attitude towards the targeted group, reinforcing the idea of implicit abuse."
12659,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text implies that 'schoep' is aligning himself with harmful ideologies associated with the term 'alt-right.' The term 'alt-right' is often associated with far-right ideologies that include elements of racism, white nationalism, and other forms of bigotry. By tagging his posts with this term, 'schoep' is implicitly aligning himself with these ideologies. This alignment requires cultural and contextual knowledge to interpret, as the term 'alt-right' carries significant negative connotations."

11071,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses coded language and abstract references to provoke racial anxiety and fear among white individuals by highlighting demographic changes that suggest a decline in the white population. The rhetorical question 'will the white race survive?' combined with the demographic data '7 in 10 children under age 1 are non-whites' is meant to create a sense of threat or concern about the future of the white race. This type of rhetoric is often used to stir up racial anxiety and can be considered implicitly abusive.
15824,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language to subtly undermine the struggles of other racial groups in South Africa. The focus on the 'white community' and their need for help could be seen as a way to shift attention away from the struggles of other racial groups. The historical context of South Africa, where white South Africans have historically held a privileged position, could make this interpretation plausible. The vagueness of 'what is happening to the white community' could be a way to imply that other groups are responsible for their suffering without explicitly stating it."
14663,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'kafirs,' which is historically derogatory and used to refer to non-Muslims in a negative context. The hashtag '#bansharia' suggests opposition to a fundamental aspect of Islamic law, and the phrase 'not out of hate but #loveoffreedom' can be seen as a disingenuous attempt to mask underlying prejudice. The overall context implies a dismissive and derogatory attitude towards Muslims, which can be interpreted as implicit abuse."
3624,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey anti-Islamic sentiment.

2234,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text aims to incite public sentiment against a political group (#traitorcongis) and their supporters by portraying them as traitors and a threat to the government. The term '#traitorcongis' is used to label a political group as traitors, which is a divisive tactic to create public outrage. The phrase 'saving frm is big loss 4 govt' suggests that inaction would be harmful, thereby creating a sense of urgency among the public.

8487,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language such as 'anti-white' and 'non-white immigration' to convey prejudicial attitudes. The term 'anti-white' carries a strong negative connotation, suggesting bias against white people. The demand for 'more non-white immigration' in the face of 'major opposition' implies a controversial and likely detrimental action, perceived as racially charged and politically motivated to alter demographic makeup."
16494,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text contains implicit prejudice by suggesting that Arabs are not truly 'white' and are only counted as such for statistical convenience. The phrase 'even w / arabs classed as whites' implies a distinction between 'true whites' and Arabs, and the statement 'whites are underrepresented per capita' can be interpreted as suggesting that Arabs are not truly part of the 'white' group. The underlying tone suggests a derogatory attitude towards Arabs, implying they are being counted as 'whites' only for the sake of argument."
8624,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily criticizes media outlets for alleged Islamophobia and calls for action against CAIR. While it may provoke strong reactions, it does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes to promote prejudice against a protected category. The text is more aligned with political commentary and criticism rather than implicit hate speech."
19083,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly reinforces the anti-Semitic stereotype by mentioning it, even if the intention is to deny it. The use of the hashtag '#jewish controlled' explicitly mentions the stereotype, which can reinforce it in the minds of the audience. The 'cc :' might be a way to spread the denial more widely, but it also spreads the stereotype."
19765,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory and dehumanizing language to provoke and troll various groups, including political and social entities. The use of terms like 'lunatic actors,' 'crooked politicians,' 'swamp creatures,' and 'vagina wearing clowns for hillary' employs coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs.

8283,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'white lives matter ! ! !' is often used in response to the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, which specifically addresses systemic racism and injustices faced by the Black community. By stating 'white lives matter ! ! !' in this context, it can be interpreted as dismissing or undermining the specific issues faced by the Black community. This interpretation suggests that the statement is meant to imply that the focus on Black lives is unnecessary or misplaced, which can be seen as abusive or dismissive."
12243,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes that all Trump voters are racist, which is a stereotype. This generalization relies on cultural and social knowledge about Trump's perceived racism. The text does not consider individual characteristics or beliefs, which is a form of implicit abuse. The phrase 'it doesn't matter your color, creed, background, or profession' reinforces the generalization by dismissing any individual differences."
6704,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implicitly associates Muslims with violence and terrorism, contributing to negative stereotypes. The phrase 'Islamic jihadists' specifically identifies a religious group, and the actions described (bombing a church and murdering people) are violent and immoral. By associating these actions with 'Islamic jihadists,' the text can be seen as perpetuating a stereotype that Muslims are violent, leading to implicit abuse by fostering negative attitudes and prejudice against Muslims."
9779,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly suggests that the abolition of slavery and the integration of African Americans into society have led to contemporary divisions in the country. The reference to Lincoln and the South indirectly alludes to the issue of slavery, and the phrase 'ridicuolously divided country' can be interpreted as blaming the current state of division on the integration of African Americans. The use of euphemistic language ('let the south go') disguises the abusive intent, making it implicit rather than explicit."
17591,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning is that the speaker is critiquing the use of the term 'white trash' as a derogatory stereotype, suggesting that such language is unnecessary and offensive. The phrase 'that's fine' could be a neutral acknowledgment of a previous statement. The use of 'white trash' in quotes followed by question marks suggests the speaker is questioning the appropriateness of the term. The statement 'doesn't need to be said imo' reinforces the idea that the speaker finds the term offensive and unnecessary."
13963,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dismiss the validity of LGBTQ+ identities and claims, implying they are based on falsehoods. The hashtags '#lgbtq' and '#lgbt' clearly target the LGBTQ+ community, and the hashtag '#lies' suggests that the author believes the community is spreading false information. The phrase 'y'all really need to stop telling that lie' reinforces a dismissive attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community's identities. The incomplete phrase 'that chai feldbl' could be a reference to a specific argument or claim made by the LGBTQ+ community that the author finds false."
4231,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text promotes an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for demographic changes and are actively working towards the destruction of white populations.

The comparison to being proud to be black might be seen as a way to justify or normalize white pride, which can be controversial given the historical context of racial dynamics."
6632,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on the issue of illegal cow smuggling, which is a legitimate concern in India due to cultural, economic, and political reasons. The use of the hashtag '#hdl' could imply a Hindu Defense League or another relevant acronym, but it does not directly target or dehumanize any protected category. The text does not contain hateful references, incitement, slurs, tropes, dehumanization, or hateful imagery. It is more aligned with a call for action, political statement, or social media activism rather than implicit hate speech."
18792,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'join the fight for the #white #workingclass' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its potential to foster racial and class tensions (Interpretation 2) and promote a sense of racial superiority (Interpretation 5). The use of the hashtags '#white' and '#workingclass' can be seen as exclusionary and divisive, potentially inciting harmful actions against other groups."
12004,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and indirect references to highlight serious social issues such as racist chants and homophobic slurs, which are forms of hate speech. The sarcastic tone and the mention of these issues imply an accusation of negligence or willful ignorance, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice indirectly."
11069,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text makes a derogatory comparison between predominantly Black countries and the practice of redlining, implying that these countries are in poor condition and suggesting that Black people are incapable of governing themselves effectively. This interpretation reinforces negative stereotypes about the capability of Black people."
11959,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language to promote racial and religious supremacy, implying that other groups are inferior. The phrase 'white race is most beautiful creation of #god' uses religious language to justify the superiority of the white race. The statement 'it must be preserved' implies that the white race is under threat from other groups, reinforcing the idea of its superiority. The phrase 'save hindus also' could be interpreted as a call to protect Hindus from perceived threats, possibly from other religious or racial groups, implying that these other groups are inferior or dangerous."
12802,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that promote white supremacist ideologies. The hashtag '#nazi' and the reference to '#14words,' a known white supremacist slogan, strongly suggest support for hateful ideologies.

7636,not_hate,0.9,"The most consistent reasoning paths suggest that the text 'all white sheriffs' is either a criticism of the lack of diversity in law enforcement, a neutral observation of demographic reality, or a call for greater inclusivity. These interpretations do not involve coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Therefore, the text does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."

This interpretation suggests that the speaker is accusing these individuals or groups of being racist and unfair, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
18281,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text directly names Mike Pence and Tony Perkins and associates them with the KKK, a notorious hate group known for its extremist views and violence against racial minorities.

8718,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'guess they'll just have to take more monuments down' can be interpreted as a neutral observation about the ongoing process of removing monuments. The phrase 'guess they'll just have to' can be seen as a simple prediction or observation, without expressing a strong opinion.

5677,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text is mocking the idea that terrorism can be attributed to a specific racial or ethnic group. The phrase 'stupid screed' suggests that the author finds the idea of linking terrorism to a specific race or ethnicity to be ridiculous. The statement 'jihad terror isn't a race' directly challenges the notion that terrorism is a racial issue. The use of quotation marks around 'white' and 'jihadis as evil' could be a way to mock the stereotyping and generalization of certain groups as inherently evil. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
12218,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'all for show . the israeli govt must be funneling money to the rebel media .' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category.

13168,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text makes a direct comparison between 'Christian white nationalists' and 'Muslim terrorists,' and explicitly states, 'we can kill them with impunity.'

21456,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implicitly abuses Muslims by depicting them as perpetrators of violent and immoral acts, specifically beheading people.

The text reinforces negative stereotypes about Muslims, portraying them as potential threats."
6471,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to race, implying that the person is a 'white racist' using a 'black man's picture to troll.'

This can be interpreted as a call for demeaning and discriminatory action against white women, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech. The truncated phrase 'please don't sho' can be interpreted as 'please don't show,' implying a command to hide or suppress something, which is demeaning and discriminatory."

8696,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudicial attitudes. The term 'jewish supremacy' is a known anti-Semitic trope, and the hashtag '#whitegenocide' is often used by white supremacists to imply that non-white groups are responsible for the supposed decline of white populations.

16411,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'they are sad that it's not a white person . lol .' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'they are sad that it's not a white person' implies a racial preference attributed to a group solely based on their racial identity, which is a form of stereotyping.

20136,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that only certain Muslims, specifically those who are 'based' (i.e., unapologetic and steadfast in their beliefs, often with extremist views), should be allowed entry.

The term 'gope' is often used in political discourse to refer to the 'Grand Old Party Establishment,' which is another name for the Republican Party establishment. The phrase 'switching the narrative' suggests a deliberate change in focus or strategy. 'Backup establishment candidate' implies that Cruz is being positioned as an alternative after the primary candidate has been deemed unsuccessful or unsuitable.

4374,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'illegals' to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is dehumanizing and conveys a negative attitude. The mention of '$1.3 trillion in retirement benefits' is framed as problematic, and the hashtags '#noamnesty' and '#immigration' reinforce an anti-immigration narrative. This combination of elements suggests an implicit prejudice against undocumented immigrants."
6090,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'is there a white chamber of congress?' can be interpreted as a rhetorical question implying criticism of the lack of diversity in Congress. While it references race, it does not promote prejudice or use coded language to demean any group.

19814,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and indirect accusations to demean and dismiss opposing viewpoints, which can be seen as promoting prejudicial attitudes without using explicit hate language. The phrase 'if you don't agree with me you are a racist' is a coded way of labeling disagreement as racism, which is a form of emotional manipulation and an attempt to shut down debate. The sarcastic remark 'yah, nice poiny' further belittles the opposing argument, contributing to a hostile environment."
4375,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to downplay and trivialize the Holocaust, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The phrase 'getting holocausted' is a euphemistic construction that trivializes the Holocaust, and the reference to 'daily stormer' reinforces the abusive context. The overall tone and context suggest a derisive and mocking attitude towards the Holocaust and its victims."
20142,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the term 'illegal criminals' to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is a loaded term that equates undocumented immigrants with criminality. This language can be seen as a form of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' where the statement relies on cultural and social context to convey an abusive implication.

10843,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the historical impact of slavery and racism on American society, highlighting the negative and harmful nature of white unity achieved through racism. This interpretation aligns with a critical analysis rather than promoting prejudice or hate."
13609,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that dehumanize and objectify a 'Christian girl,' suggesting a possessive and manipulative attitude. The religious and cultural context adds layers of complexity, hinting at power dynamics that exacerbate the derogatory tone. The use of metaphorical language like 'smooshed so much love' and 'to be * his own *' implies coercion and control, which are consistent with implicit hate speech."
8138,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses the historically loaded and often derogatory term 'miscegenation' to discuss interracial relationships on plantations. By stating that the rate was 'less than 1 percent per annum,' the text minimizes the significance or impact of such relationships, which can be interpreted as a form of implicit abuse. This minimization suggests that interracial relationships were rare and therefore not a significant issue, which aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech by using coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
11992,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'yikes ! don't trust your daughter to a staffer either . #lgbt rt' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey a prejudicial attitude towards LGBTQ+ individuals. The phrase 'don't trust your daughter to a staffer either' suggests a generalization that LGBTQ+ staffers are untrustworthy, particularly in relation to children. The hashtag '#lgbt' specifies the target group, and the term 'yikes' adds an emotional reaction of shock or disapproval. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes abstract or coded references to protected characteristics and the use of stereotypes."

6719,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly states that any white man winning an argument with individuals from these groups is a racist. This statement relies on stereotypes and coded language to convey a negative message about white men. The use of hashtags reinforces the categorization and generalization, making the abusive intent more subtle but still present.

The term 'odd' is used to convey curiosity or surprise rather than judgment."
21374,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'Lol, Asian gay guys are too girly, I suppose.' uses humor to convey a stereotype about Asian gay men being 'too girly.' This stereotype is a form of implicit hate speech because it degrades a protected category (Asian gay men) through a generalized and derogatory statement. The use of 'Lol' and 'I suppose' attempts to disguise the insult as humor, but the underlying message reinforces negative stereotypes."

The term 'illegal aliens' is used to dehumanize immigrants by likening them to non-human entities, and the phrase 'farce of a country' implies that the presence of immigrants is a negative aspect that makes the country a 'farce.' The overall tone and language suggest a derogatory attitude towards immigrants."

There is no direct or indirect targeting of individuals or groups based on protected characteristics. The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
12359,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning is that the text is ambiguous and can be interpreted as an accusation of racism, a confrontation with a racist, a victim of racism, overcoming racism, a misunderstanding, or sarcasm. None of these interpretations directly or indirectly promote prejudice or use coded language to convey hate."
17200,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

The phrase 'islamists throughout the white house' and hashtags like '#stopislam' and '#crusades' implicitly convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs. The overall message is designed to spread anti-Muslim sentiment and promote Islamophobia.
19542,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text expresses a strong xenophobic and racist sentiment against immigrants from developing countries. It suggests that these immigrants are a threat to Western societies and that their well-being is of no concern. The phrase 'third world immigration will destroy western civilization' generalizes immigrants from developing countries as a threat. The term 'brown people' reduces immigrants to a mere color, implying they are interchangeable and less than human. The phrase 'who gives a shit' is dismissive and dehumanizing, showing indifference to the well-being of immigrants. The text implicitly calls for action by suggesting that immigration from third world countries should be stopped or limited to prevent the supposed destruction of Western civilization."
19143,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'lol. yes, africa isn't a developed land because of whites.' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it directly assigns blame to white people for Africa's underdevelopment. The use of 'lol' could be seen as a way to soften the statement or express resignation, but the core message reinforces a negative stereotype about a protected category (race). This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes coded language and stereotypes."
7246,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and hashtags that are associated with white supremacist ideologies and calls for action against perceived threats to white dominance. The hashtags '#14words' and '#maga' are particularly indicative of implicit hate speech, as they are known to be used by groups with divisive and racially charged sentiments. The phrase 'the days of whites failing to notice our own displacement are over' reinforces a sense of racial grievance and a call for action, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
21082,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests suicide as a solution to depression, which can be interpreted as a call for harmful action. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language to promote a harmful idea without explicitly using slurs or hate language. The use of dark humor and the attempt to shock or provoke also contribute to the implicit nature of the hate speech."
12230,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text promotes a revisionist view of history by asserting that white nationalism was the primary force behind the development of America. This aligns with the idea of promoting a harmful and divisive message.

523,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest a conspiracy theory involving the ADL and white nationalism. This indirectly promotes prejudice by implying that the ADL, an organization known for combating anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, is secretly involved in manipulating or promoting white nationalism.

932,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that organizations like the ADL and SPLC are biased against white people, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The use of '#fakenews' and the derisive tone towards these organizations and those who trust them reinforces negative stereotypes and promotes prejudice."
17898,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implicitly endorses harmful ideologies by expressing respect for known white supremacist and neo-Nazi figures, Hunter Wallace and Matt Heimbach. This endorsement can be seen as a form of implicit abuse, as it subtly promotes ideologies that are harmful to certain groups."
7777,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'great being white so proud !' can be interpreted as subtly promoting the idea that being white is superior to other races. The phrase 'great being white' suggests a positive sentiment towards being white, and the exclamation 'so proud !' adds an emotional layer that could be interpreted as pride in being part of a superior group. This interpretation aligns with the concept of Euphemistic Constructions and Stereotypes, where the text uses coded language to imply racial superiority."
17777,not_hate,0.9,"The statement 'canada : imam claims that islam is the most feminist religion' can be interpreted as a neutral report of a claim made by an imam.

This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
485,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text subtly implies that the presence of women in the alt-right movement is problematic and contributes to the failure of online movements. The phrase 'these issues tend to sort out' suggests that women are a problem that needs to be resolved. The term 'women issue' is used in a way that suggests women are a problem, and the statement 'another reason why online movements don't work' implies that the 'women issue' is a hindrance."
7336,not_hate,0.8,"The text 'we must cut off his free speech #antifa #resist' is more likely a call for political activism rather than a direct call to suppress free speech. The hashtags '#antifa' and '#resist' are often associated with political activism and resistance movements, suggesting that the speaker is advocating for resistance against what they perceive as harmful speech. This interpretation aligns with political activism rather than implicit hate speech."
12861,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote a racist conspiracy theory. The phrase 'white genocide' is commonly used in racist discourse to imply that white people are being systematically replaced or eliminated. The mention of 'ending race' could be interpreted as a desire to eliminate racial diversity, which aligns with the idea of 'white genocide.' The phrase 'an amorphous cultureless slave race' dehumanizes certain groups by suggesting they lack culture and are inferior, which is a common tactic in racist rhetoric."
13793,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'white pride' is historically and culturally associated with white supremacist movements. The use of 'white pride' in the context of a product description can be seen as a subtle endorsement of these ideologies. The term 'worldwide' suggests a global reach or appeal, which could imply an attempt to spread or normalize these beliefs on a larger scale."
3584,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text implies that individuals are being banned for speaking negatively about Islam, which could be interpreted as an anti-Muslim sentiment. The phrase 'speak truth about islam' suggests a negative view of Islam, and the tone indicates disapproval of government actions protecting Muslims from criticism.

12328,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text equates FAIR with 'white supremacist hate' and labels it as an 'anti immigrant organization,' which are coded references to racial and ethnic prejudice. The hashtag '#bewarefair' serves as a warning, implying that FAIR's activities should be viewed with caution, which can be seen as inciting fear and spreading fearful stereotypes."
11397,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'completely understandable but theres a narrative here . the calls for white people to' is incomplete and lacks sufficient context to definitively classify it as implicit hate speech. While it mentions 'white people,' it does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The most consistent reasoning is that the text is an incomplete thought, making it difficult to determine the full context or intention. Therefore, it is classified as 'not_hate.'"
6971,implicit_hate,0.85,"The term 'pro-white' is often used as a euphemism for white supremacist or racist views. By endorsing Spencer as a 'good pro-white spokesman,' the speaker is implicitly supporting views that are derogatory towards other racial or ethnic groups. This interpretation requires cultural and social knowledge to understand the implicit meaning behind the term 'pro-white.'"
15768,not_hate,0.85,"The text critiques societal double standards based on ethnicity or religion, highlighting how violent acts by white individuals are often justified or tolerated, while similar acts by Muslims are met with severe consequences. This interpretation is supported by the juxtaposition of the phrases 'price of freedom' and 'time to ban or deport them,' which underscores a biased and prejudiced viewpoint. However, the text does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it aims to provoke thought and critique by highlighting the inconsistency in societal reactions."
4696,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that diversity is harmful to social harmony. The phrase 'overwhelming diversity' implies that diversity is excessive and problematic, and 'undermine social cohesion' suggests that diversity is a threat to the unity and stability of society. This interpretation relies on cultural and social knowledge, where diversity is often associated with immigration and multiculturalism. The use of indirect language can be seen as a euphemistic way to express negative sentiments towards diversity without being overtly offensive."
20475,implicit_hate,0.85,The text uses coded language and abstract references to stereotype a particular ethnic group as being prone to terrorism and cowardice. The phrase 'they will do anything for terror' and 'pull their god during the attacks' can be interpreted as a way to demonize certain ethnicities by linking their religious practices to violent acts. The term 'cowards' further reinforces negative stereotypes.
4310,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to imply that the person in question is not genuinely a friend of the Jews, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against the Jewish community.

The use of terms like 'white genocide' and 'holodomor' is designed to evoke strong emotional responses and resentment. The call for reparations suggests that Jewish people are to blame for these events, thereby inciting hatred.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to convey a derogatory message about a protected category (race).

18011,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'just calling you white thought you were proud' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes. The phrase 'just calling you white' categorizes the person based on race, and 'thought you were proud' implies an assumption about the emotional response of the person being categorized. This generalizes the emotional state of pride to all white people, which is a harmful stereotype. Additionally, the implication that being white should evoke pride can be interpreted as suggesting racial superiority, reinforcing a hierarchy where whiteness is valued more highly."

It's too heavy for you.' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it reinforces gender stereotypes about physical strength. The phrase 'It's too heavy for you' suggests that the speaker believes the person is incapable of carrying the item, and the request to 'get one of the boys to carry that out' implies that boys are more capable of handling the task. This can be seen as subtly abusive or demeaning because it reinforces negative stereotypes about the physical capabilities of individuals based on their gender."

2423,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily critiques media coverage of the 9/11 attacks, suggesting incomplete or misleading reporting. While it uses provocative language, it does not target any protected category or promote prejudice. The terms 'redline on 9/11,' 'media fakery,' and 'limited hangout' are more aligned with conspiracy theories and media criticism rather than hate speech."
10021,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the term 'white genocide,' which is a coded phrase often used by white supremacist groups to imply that the white race is being systematically eliminated or replaced.

16180,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses euphemistic constructions to subtly dismiss or downplay the seriousness of the accusations against Trump. By questioning the timing and motivation of the accusations, the text indirectly suggests that they are not genuine but rather politically motivated. This approach can be seen as a form of implicit hate speech, as it indirectly dismisses the seriousness of the accusations, which include racism, sexism, and rape—all of which are protected categories."
14800,implicit_hate,0.9,The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial supremacy and fear-mongering. The statement 'whites need to start looking out for themselves' implies a generalized belief that white people are under threat and need to act in self-interest. The comparison to South Africa is often used in racist rhetoric to suggest that white people are under threat or will be marginalized. This interpretation is supported by the context and the use of indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes.

12648,not_hate,0.9,"The text is sarcastically critiquing the person being addressed for having a limited and stereotypical view of black people. The statement implies that the person has only met one black person and is basing their views on this limited experience.

6103,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'it's amazing how they know who is a jew vs non-jew' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its potential to reinforce negative stereotypes and highlight discriminatory practices. The use of 'amazing' in a sarcastic or critical tone suggests a critique of stereotyping and discrimination, which aligns with the features of implicit hate speech.

115,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reinforces stereotypes about the group's political choices, suggesting that they are inherently foolish or ignorant for supporting a party that is perceived to be against them. The phrase 'the party that obviously hates them' perpetuates a stereotypical belief that the group is making an irrational decision. The rhetorical question format and the repetition of question marks reinforce the stereotype by implying that the group's decision is so obviously wrong that it doesn't warrant a genuine answer. The text suggests that the speaker holds a prejudiced view of the group's political choices, reinforcing negative stereotypes about their judgment and intelligence."
17367,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'little marxists' to stereotype left-leaning individuals as being irrationally fearful of white people gathering. This interpretation relies on the understanding that the term 'little marxists' is used pejoratively and that the statement is meant to mock or belittle those with left-leaning views. The context of 'two or more white people gathering' suggests that the anxiety is specifically directed towards white people gathering, which could be interpreted as a commentary on perceived racial tensions."
12058,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and metaphors to convey prejudicial attitudes towards Chinese and non-Mexican immigrants. The phrase 'fake chinese asylum' suggests that Chinese asylum seekers are fraudulent, and 'trojan horsed on borders otm' implies that these immigrants are a hidden threat.

9043,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice and incite violence. The phrase 'swedish islamophobia expert who joined isis calls for attacks in sweden' indirectly targets Muslims by associating them with terrorism and violence.

The juxtaposition of an Islamophobia expert joining ISIS is used to justify the call for attacks, implying that even experts are turning to extremism."
3690,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the political strategy of focusing on a group (Muslims) that is unlikely to support the BJP. The phrase 'why are you obsessed with few muslims' suggests that the focus on Muslims is excessive, and 'when you know well that they will not vote for bjp' implies that the effort is futile. The rhetorical question format indicates a critique of the ineffectiveness of the strategy rather than promoting prejudice."
21298,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses a harmful stereotype about Black individuals, suggesting that they come from broken families. This stereotype is often used to demean and ridicule Black people. The joke format disguises the abusive nature of the statement, making it seem like harmless humor.

The phrase 'lets hope' can be seen as sarcastic, implying that the speaker does not actually hope for this outcome. The specific mention of 'white American' suggests a critique of how the media or society might react differently if the perpetrator were white.

7994,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses highly inflammatory language such as 'anti-white show' and 'promotes white genocide,' which are coded ways of expressing racial animosity.

2535,not_hate,0.85,"While the statement could be interpreted as fear-mongering, it does not directly target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics. The language used is political and does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The focus is on policy debate rather than dehumanization or incitement against a protected category."
20989,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates a racial stereotype that Chinese people are inherently superior due to their race. The phrase 'Why is Chinese the best race?' directly suggests a comparison and ranking of races, implying that one race is superior to others. The statement 'They can do everything with their eyes closed' reinforces this superiority by attributing an extraordinary ability to Chinese people. This generalization is not based on individual merit but on a stereotypical belief about the race, which is a form of implicit abuse."

7999,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'no it means black south africans didn't exist until the end of apartheid' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its dehumanizing and dismissive tone. The phrase 'didn't exist' metaphorically implies that Black South Africans were not recognized as fully human or significant, aligning with the concept of dehumanization. Additionally, it suggests historical erasure by implying that their struggles and experiences were only acknowledged after apartheid ended. The dismissive tone indicates a lack of respect for the experiences and identities of Black South Africans, which is supported by the historical context of apartheid."
78,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that anti-racist efforts are inherently anti-white, which is a divisive and derogatory statement.

6093,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text singles out Israel, a predominantly Jewish state, as the perpetrator of spying and planning a move against the white race. This can be seen as a way to demonize Israel and, by extension, Jewish people. The implication of a racial motive ('against the white race') adds a layer of racial tension, which is often a component of anti-Semitic rhetoric. The use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice without explicit slurs aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
2742,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'where do i sign up brotherfuck yaeh white' contains coded language and derogatory terms that indirectly promote prejudice.

3447,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'philip girladi interview jewish americans pushing wars via' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes to promote an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The phrase 'jewish americans pushing wars via' directly attributes the action of pushing wars to Jewish Americans, aligning with historical and contemporary anti-Semitic tropes that accuse Jewish people of manipulating global events for nefarious purposes. The context of an interview with Philip Giraldi, known for controversial views, supports the idea that the text is intended to spread a conspiracy theory."

20341,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses dehumanizing and derogatory language to refer to undocumented immigrants, implying they are a threat to society. The term 'illegals' is derogatory and dehumanizing, as it reduces individuals to their legal status and implies criminality.

15427,implicit_hate,0.75,"The phrase 'real white beauty' explicitly mentions race and emphasizes skin color as a defining characteristic of beauty. This can be seen as a microaggression, suggesting that beauty is tied to whiteness, which is problematic and promotes prejudicial attitudes."
20796,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'they have guns? use them you assholes!' can be interpreted as a call for harmful action and provocation. The direct and imperative phrase 'use them you assholes!' combined with the derogatory term 'assholes' suggests an abusive tone and a challenge to take violent action. This aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action,' where harmful actions are urged against a group. Additionally, the provocative nature of the statement questions the recipients' courage or competence, adding a layer of provocation."
5189,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language ('alt-right is all races / groups pro-america exposes liars') to convey its message, which can be interpreted as a way to implicitly bias the reader against mainstream media and political figures. The accusation of lying and the questioning of trustworthiness can be seen as a form of implicit abuse, targeting those who disagree with the alt-right's views."
9046,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'heil und seig' is a subtle reference to Nazi salutes and ideology. 'Heil' is a common greeting in Nazi salutations, and 'seig' is a misspelling of 'sieg,' which means 'victory' in German. The combination 'heil und seig' can be interpreted as 'hail and victory,' which aligns with Nazi rhetoric. The use of this phrase in the context of the text suggests support for extremist ideologies. The casual tone ('thanks brother i appreciate it') followed by the extremist phrase indicates a hidden, implicit endorsement of harmful ideologies."
8278,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses the coded term 'white genocide,' which is often employed by white supremacists to imply the systematic replacement or elimination of white people. The removal of portraits of white male professors is presented as evidence of this alleged 'genocide,' subtly promoting racist views. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes abstract or coded references to race and the promotion of prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
2773,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'white power south georgia has your back' contains coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice and white supremacist ideologies. The phrase 'white power' is strongly associated with white supremacy, and the context of 'South Georgia' adds a layer of regional tension. The statement 'has your back' implies support and solidarity among white supremacists, which can be interpreted as a call to action, intimidation, recruitment, expression of pride, or provocation. All these interpretations align with the features of implicit hate speech."
14894,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily focuses on criticizing the Obama administration's surveillance policies, comparing them to those of the Bush administration. The hashtags '#criminal', '#policestate', '#bigbrother', and '#freedom' suggest concerns about government overreach and civil liberties rather than targeting any protected category. There are no coded references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected characteristics."
8849,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about Jews having their own ethnostate and dehumanizing white gentiles. The term 'hypocrites' is a negative comparison that implies moral failing. This interpretation fits the subtypes of implicit abuse, including 'Stereotypes,' 'Perpetrators,' and 'Comparisons.' The text relies on cultural and social knowledge to convey an abusive message, fitting the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse.'"
1009,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text employs sarcasm and dismissive language to suggest that opponents of National Socialism are uninformed and rely on unreliable sources of information.

9857,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'jews are still white' can be interpreted as minimizing the unique experiences and discrimination faced by Jewish people by categorizing them as 'white,' which suggests they do not face the same level of systemic racism as other non-white minority groups. This aligns with the category of implicit abuse by relying on cultural and social knowledge to convey a derogatory implication."
17972,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against a black politician. The terms 'infiltrator' and 'anti-white ethnic cleansing' are designed to incite fear and mistrust among the white population, suggesting that the politician poses a direct threat. This interpretation is supported by the use of alarming language and divisive rhetoric, which are key features of implicit hate speech."
3919,not_hate,0.95,"The text emphasizes the political power of the common people and warns political entities not to underestimate this power.

3802,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the U.S. justice system, highlighting its failures and corruption. The phrase 'just-us' is a play on words suggesting bias, and the hashtags '#hatecrime' and '#news' indicate a focus on current events related to hate crimes. There is no coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect promotion of prejudice that would classify it as implicit hate speech."
16218,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text promotes a conspiracy theory that Jews are planning to disarm and commit genocide against white people.

9137,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'trump normalized white supremacy and islamophobia' is a critique of political impact and historical analysis rather than an expression of hate. It does not use coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes to promote prejudice. Instead, it critiques the societal impact of Trump's presidency, which aligns with political commentary and activist statements aimed at raising awareness about harmful effects on marginalized communities."
1560,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'not white in the head' uses the word 'white' in a context that suggests purity or clarity of thought. By stating that someone is 'not white in the head,' it implies that they are not thinking clearly or are mentally deficient. The term 'white' in this context can be interpreted as having racial undertones, suggesting that clarity of thought is associated with being 'white.' The mention of 'breitbart' adds a layer of context, as Breitbart News is known for its conservative and often controversial content, which can further imply a derogatory or abusive intent."
7637,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'all white sheriffs ? subtle . #racist #bigotry' is most consistently interpreted as a critique of systemic racism within law enforcement. The phrase 'all white sheriffs' highlights a lack of diversity, and the hashtags '#racist' and '#bigotry' reinforce the idea that this lack of diversity is seen as a manifestation of systemic racism and bigotry. The use of the word 'subtle' and the question mark suggest an underlying problem that is not overt but needs attention. This interpretation aligns with a call to address and change the system rather than promoting prejudice."
12868,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implicitly blames black people for violence within their community and absolves white people of any responsibility. The phrase 'white men aren't in charge' suggests that white men are not responsible for the actions of black people, while 'black people killing each other' reinforces a stereotype that black people are inherently violent. This subtly shifts blame away from any systemic or societal factors that might contribute to violence and instead places the blame solely on the black community."
6584,not_hate,0.95,"The text advocates for increased engagement in free speech and religious liberty, which are core libertarian values. It critiques government overreach but does not target any protected category with abuse, dehumanization, or incitement. The language is direct and does not use coded or abstract references to promote prejudice."
5691,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'i can't love my mum because she's not muslim' generalizes the beliefs and behaviors of Muslims, implying a causal relationship that stereotypes Muslims as intolerant. The hashtags #islamophobia and #antimuslim could be interpreted as the speaker's awareness of the stereotyping, but they are still using it to make a point, which aligns with the features of implicit hate speech."
14596,implicit_hate,0.85,The text perpetuates an anti-Semitic stereotype by attributing a negative characteristic ('illogical hatred') to Jewish people. This generalization aligns with historical and cultural stereotypes that have been used to marginalize and discriminate against Jewish people. The specific mention of 'some white men' could be interpreted as a way to justify or rationalize anti-Semitic sentiments by implying that Jewish people are unreasonably hostile towards a specific group.
13632,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text aims to instill fear and promote negative stereotypes about Muslims by suggesting that a significant number of them are radical and violent, specifically targeting Christians and Jews. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech as it uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
17625,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'I've examined video clips with people and I see a total different person not media narrative.' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

12649,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text implies a negative view of Arab and Muslim communities, suggesting that the 'Arab Winter' (a term often used to describe the negative outcomes of the Arab Spring) is coming to America, which could be interpreted as a warning about the perceived dangers of Muslim influence. Robert Spencer is known for his controversial and often Islamophobic views, and the term 'Arab Winter' suggests a pessimistic view of the Arab Spring, which is often associated with political instability and violence. The phrase 'comes to America' could be interpreted as a warning about the spread of negative influences from the Arab world to the United States."
20288,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and derogatory terms such as 'illegals' to convey a message of exclusion and superiority of Americans over immigrants. The call to end sanctuary cities and prioritize Americans, along with the ambiguous phrase 'let illegals come in the rig,' suggests a dismissive and dehumanizing attitude towards immigrants.

7137,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly states that the author 'advocated white separatism instead of white nationalism.' White separatism is an ideology that promotes the separation of white people from other racial groups. This advocacy can be seen as a call for action to promote racial segregation. Historically, such ideologies have been associated with racism and discrimination. Therefore, the text can be interpreted as promoting harmful and abusive actions that undermine societal cohesion and equality."
918,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses divisive language and creates a clear contrast between different political and social groups, suggesting that one group is more likely to be arrested than the other. The phrase 'makes you think' could be seen as a provocation, encouraging the reader to take sides. This interpretation fits with the idea of 'Perpetrators,' where a specific group is depicted as responsible for crimes, creating a negative association and fostering division."
17876,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that convey prejudicial attitudes towards white people. The commands 'dont make anymore' and 'take all the pills' can be interpreted as calls for harmful actions, including self-harm or suicide, directed specifically at white people.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that promotes prejudice."

The use of 'conversion or coercion' might simply be a way to explore different perspectives without implying a negative connotation. This interpretation suggests that the author is genuinely curious about the topic and is not making an accusation."
10600,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text makes a broad, stereotypical generalization about black males, suggesting that they have a negative attitude towards women, particularly white women. This generalization is used to explain why black males might not vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC). The statement 'many black males hate women particularly white women' is a clear stereotype and is used to imply that black males have a negative attitude towards women. This stereotype is then connected to voting behavior, suggesting that this negative attitude influenced their decision not to vote for HRC. The use of 'partly because' indicates that this stereotype is one of the reasons for their voting behavior."
889,implicit_hate,0.7,"The text 'white welcome aboard glad to have you' can be interpreted as having a racial undertone.

5419,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reflects racial anxiety and resentment towards the perceived decline of white America, using Paul Krugman as a symbol of this sentiment.

2079,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text promotes an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory by suggesting that Jewish people are controlling social networks and using them to promote anti-white sentiments. The phrase 'jewish ruled' implies Jewish control, and 'anti-white racist social network' suggests this control is used to promote racism against white people. The mention of 'zuckerberg's dream' ties this conspiracy to Mark Zuckerberg, who is Jewish, further reinforcing the stereotype."
7920,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm and irony to convey a negative and prejudicial attitude towards individuals who might enter the country through diversity visas. The phrase 'those who hate & want to kill us' is a coded reference to a perceived threat from a specific group, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech.

While it may carry negative connotations, it does not directly target or dehumanize any protected category based on race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. The language used is not coded or abstract enough to be classified as implicit hate speech."
15711,not_hate,0.9,"The text does not contain coded language, abstract references, or stereotypes that promote prejudice against any protected category. The phrase 'rallies where you kill and shoot people' is an exaggerated statement meant to ridicule or dismiss an idea, and the follow-up statements reinforce a dismissive or mocking tone rather than promoting hate. The use of 'you're crazy' is a negative comparison but does not target any specific protected category."
15918,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and sarcasm to dismiss and mock liberals, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against a political group. The phrase 'atone deaf' is a play on words that ridicules the idea of atonement, and the repetition of 'you owe us the apologies - a lot ! !' suggests that liberals are the ones who should apologize, which is a form of implicit insult or criticism."
12476,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that could be interpreted as promoting prejudice against protected categories.

7584,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'dr. david duke: will the white race survive?' is a rhetorical question used to imply that the white race is under threat and needs to be protected. This interpretation aligns with white supremacist ideologies. The contextual knowledge that David Duke is a well-known white supremacist and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, along with the historical context of the phrase being used by white supremacists to suggest that the white race is endangered, supports this interpretation. The question is not seeking a genuine answer but is intended to provoke fear and rally support for white supremacist causes."
20801,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references that can be interpreted as targeting marginalized groups. The phrase 'round them up!' is often used in contexts where marginalized groups are targeted, such as immigrants or protesters. The lack of specificity in 'them' allows for a broad interpretation, which can include various marginalized communities. The urgency in 'do your job!' implies that law enforcement is not doing enough to address perceived violations, which can be interpreted as a call to action against these groups. The dehumanizing tone suggests a lack of empathy and respect for the targeted individuals."
5107,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text can be interpreted as criticizing Hispanics for not identifying as white, implying that they should. This interpretation suggests a stereotype about their racial identity and can be seen as abusive or derogatory, questioning the authenticity of their racial identity.

Instead, it questions the person's focus on 'black nationalism' while suggesting they should also address 'white nationalism,' emphasizing fairness and consistency rather than promoting prejudice."
9723,implicit_hate,0.9,The text promotes the idea of Aryan supremacy and suggests that Iranians should reject their current identity in favor of a supposedly superior Aryan identity. The term 'aryan bretheren' has strong historical and cultural connotations of racial superiority. The phrase 'iran must give up islam' can be seen as a rejection of a perceived inferior religious identity. The phrase 'save yourself' implies that embracing Aryan identity is the path to salvation and superiority.
5108,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on environmental practices and corruption, which do not target any protected categories. The use of 'massive oil pipeline' and 'hiding chemicals' suggests criticism of harmful environmental activities rather than prejudice against any specific group."
1607,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'pro-american pro-identitarian easily defensible easy to understand great optics' immediate context suggests it could be part of a social movement's rhetoric. The term 'pro-identitarian' is often associated with far-right movements that promote nationalist and exclusionary ideologies, which can be coded language for prejudice against immigrants, minorities, and other protected categories. The combination of 'pro-american' and 'pro-identitarian' with terms like 'easily defensible' and 'great optics' suggests a strategic appeal to nationalist sentiments, which can be a form of implicit hate speech."

It does not reference any protected categories such as race, ethnicity, religion, or gender, nor does it use coded language or stereotypes to promote prejudice. The focus is on the malicious intent and unethical behavior of an unspecified group, which does not fall under the definition of implicit hate speech."
7211,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'so we have new scientific developments that show that these groups are now white people?' can be interpreted as sarcastic and meant to mock or belittle certain groups by questioning their racial or ethnic identity. The use of the phrase 'new scientific developments' suggests a skeptical or dismissive tone, and the question mark at the end implies disbelief or incredulity. This kind of statement can be seen as implying that these groups are not truly 'white' and are only being considered as such due to some new, presumably dubious, scientific developments. This interpretation relies on cultural and social context to convey its abusive intent, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
2012,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text mentions Dieudonné and Robert Faurisson, both known for their Holocaust denial and anti-Semitic views. The context of the Holocaust in conjunction with their names implies a context that is likely to be offensive to many people, particularly those affected by the Holocaust.

18232,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text is intended to mock or belittle liberals by suggesting they are naive or uninformed. The phrase 'the only people who seem surprised by this' implies that the surprise is unwarranted or foolish. By specifically mentioning 'liberals,' the text singles out this group as being particularly naive or uninformed. This aligns with the concept of Euphemistic Constructions, where the abusive intent is disguised in indirect language."
19837,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses sarcasm to suggest that diversity might not be beneficial in the context of math scores, which can be interpreted as promoting a stereotype that certain groups are less capable in academic performance. This indirectly conveys a prejudicial attitude towards diversity initiatives and could be seen as implicit hate speech."
9289,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text suggests that black people are subservient to white people and are being controlled or manipulated by them. The phrase 'black minions' implies that black people are being treated as subservient or inferior beings. The term 'minions' is often used to describe servants or followers who are subordinate to a more powerful figure. The phrase 'answering to da 'white man'' reinforces the idea that black people are under the control or authority of white people. The use of 'talcum x' as a derogatory term for a black person (a play on the name Malcolm X) further emphasizes the dehumanizing intent, suggesting that black people are being ridiculed or belittled."
10289,not_hate,0.85,"The text is highlighting a perceived racial bias in the interpretation of religious symbols. It suggests that the cross, a symbol of Christianity, is seen as exclusive to white people in the minds of some white individuals.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and sarcasm to convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
18029,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text dehumanizes the white race by comparing them to a species that can go extinct and implies racial superiority by suggesting that the original human race was black. The use of 'lol' adds a dismissive and mocking tone, further emphasizing the derogatory nature of the statement."
15688,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that non-white individuals are detrimental to Western societies. The phrase 'forcing diversity on the white west' implies that the presence of non-white individuals is unwanted and harmful. The statement 'race determines culture' can be seen as a way to justify racial segregation, suggesting that different races should maintain separate cultures. The claim that 'race relations continue to decline' due to diversity suggests that racial tensions are the fault of non-white individuals. The term 'delusional' is used to dismiss any arguments against this prejudiced viewpoint."
20113,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'illegals' to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is dehumanizing.

8767,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning is Interpretation 1: Sarcasm. The phrase 'i guess' often indicates uncertainty or reluctance, and the use of 'too' suggests that the speaker is responding to someone else being labeled a racist. The combination of these elements implies that the speaker is mocking the idea of being called a racist. Sarcasm is a common rhetorical device used to dismiss or belittle accusations, which does not directly promote prejudice or hatred."
4838,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to glorify a Nazi figure and promote white supremacist ideologies.

10853,not_hate,0.85,"The text is exploring the complexities of identity and belonging, questioning how individuals perceive and define their own and others' identities within a racial context. The phrase 'some white people aren't white people' can be seen as questioning the criteria for belonging to a racial group, focusing on the fluidity and subjectivity of identity.

The statement 'british people are white :)' generalizes that all British people are white, which is an abstract reference to race. The phrase 'i wouldn't call them british' implies exclusion based on race, and the use of the smiley face ':)' suggests a casual or dismissive tone that minimizes the seriousness of the exclusionary statement. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it promotes prejudice through indirect and coded language."
3385,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'mossad agents cheered 9/11 says american jewish academic at anti-israel conference in ireland' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The mention of 'Mossad agents cheered 9/11' implies that Israeli intelligence agents were happy about the 9/11 attacks, which is a harmful and anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The context of an 'anti-Israel conference' suggests a negative and abusive implication directed towards Jewish people and Israel. The attribution to an 'American Jewish academic' adds a layer of credibility to the claim, making it more likely to be believed by some readers. This interpretation aligns with the analysis that the text falls under the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' relying on cultural and social knowledge to imply harmful and anti-Semitic ideas."
149,not_hate,0.9,"The most consistent reasoning is that the text is a direct call for violence against an individual, which is explicit rather than implicit.

4147,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'i love it ! black female writer : too many white people at american colleges via' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly indicate implicit hate speech. The phrase 'too many white people' could be seen as a critique of systemic inequality or an expression of frustration with the lack of diversity, rather than an attack on white people. The exclamation 'i love it !' adds complexity, suggesting either genuine enthusiasm or sarcasm, but it does not promote prejudice or dehumanization. The context of a 'black female writer' making this observation adds a personal perspective that is more likely to be a call for awareness or a critique of the status quo rather than hate speech."

This interpretation aligns with the use of coded language and abstract references to promote prejudicial attitudes."
12202,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about 'Islamic caliphate,' suggesting a broad stereotype about Islamic governance. The negative connotations of 'diminish' and 'devastate' reinforce this stereotype. The phrase 'let alone for cruisers' extends the stereotype to include all types of maritime activities.

21017,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses euphemistic language to disguise the abusive intent, referring to the genocide of people with disabilities during the Holocaust in an understated manner. The phrase 'cured tons of disabilities' is a euphemism for the mass murder of disabled individuals, and the use of the term 'good doctor' masks the true, horrific nature of the actions, making the statement implicitly abusive."
19815,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text dehumanizes women by comparing them to slaves, which is a form of dehumanization. The use of the term 'indoctrinated' suggests that these women have been brainwashed, further reducing their agency and individuality. The phrase 'these are female human beings indoctrinated and forced by a misogynist religion to live a life of slavery' explicitly states that women are being oppressed by religious beliefs, which can be seen as a form of implicit hate speech."
15111,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text perpetuates stereotypes about the BLM movement by generalizing that it is 'overwhelmingly white' and citing specific individuals who are white or perceived as white. This interpretation promotes misconceptions and stereotypes about the movement and its participants, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
10380,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language to communicate with a specific group of extremists. The term 'non-white invaders' is a coded way to refer to immigrants or refugees, understood only by those familiar with the extremist ideology. The call to 'burn down facilities' is a coded message for violent action, understood by the intended audience. The use of 'swedish patriots' is a way to signal to the group that the message is from a like-minded individual, reinforcing group cohesion."
18133,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'remember harvard professor who wants to abolish the white race' contains coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice against a specific racial group. The phrase 'abolish the white race' is inflammatory and divisive, and the mention of a Harvard professor adds a layer of academic authority, making the statement more impactful. The text does not explicitly call for action but implies an underlying abusive intent by promoting a controversial idea. Additionally, it could be a piece of misinformation or propaganda aimed at stirring controversy and division."
16524,implicit_hate,0.9,"The phrase 'white genocide' is a known dog whistle used by white supremacist groups to suggest that white people are being systematically eliminated or replaced. This narrative is a common theme in white supremacist ideology and is used to spread fear and mistrust. The mention of 'a 100 year history' implies a long-standing conspiracy or threat against white people, which aligns with the rhetoric used by hate groups."
3609,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'wait i don't understand why is it all white people?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations suggest implicit hate speech. The most consistent reasoning is that the speaker is either criticizing the lack of diversity, expressing surprise, calling for inclusivity, using sarcasm or irony to highlight the lack of diversity, seeking clarification, or highlighting privilege. None of these interpretations involve coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice."
5454,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily focuses on encouraging unity, active participation, and support within a faith community. It does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The language is motivational and aimed at fostering a sense of community and engagement within a religious context."
1845,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'why are our parks so white?' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations suggest implicit hate speech. Instead, they point towards a critique of lack of diversity, a call for inclusivity, an observation of demographic trends, a critique of systemic issues, a provocation for discussion, or an expression of frustration. These interpretations do not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Therefore, the text is classified as not implicit hate speech."
11818,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text accuses Democrats of being racist and manipulative towards Black people. The phrase 'hate & need to control #blacklives' can be interpreted as a coded message suggesting that Democrats are racist. The term 'control' implies manipulation, which is often associated with systemic racism. The use of 'burns strong' suggests that this racism is not just a passing issue but a deeply rooted problem within the DNC and Democrats. This interpretation fits the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse' as it relies on cultural and social knowledge to convey a derogatory message."
19685,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text dehumanizes a group by comparing them to 'ugly monkeys' and suggesting that even monkeys are better looking. This comparison is a common trope in racial slurs and is inherently derogatory and abusive, even if disguised as humor or sarcasm. The use of such language is intended to provoke a reaction and gain attention, but it does not negate the underlying abusive and dehumanizing nature of the statement."
21299,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text reflects a genuine belief in racial stereotypes and justifies discriminatory policies by suggesting that African Americans should only be educated in fields where they are stereotypically expected to succeed. The use of the term 'negro,' the explicit statement that African Americans can only succeed in certain fields, and the decision to change inner-city schools into conservatories for the arts based on these stereotypes all contribute to the implicit hate speech classification."
8628,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against law enforcement by associating them with the KKK, a well-known hate group. The phrase 'death to them' and 'your time is now' add a sense of urgency and threat, which can incite fear and encourage harassment or discrimination. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."

4065,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward news headline reporting an accusation of a money laundering scam involving NDTV and Chidambaram, with the alleged amount being Rs. 5500 crore. The text is structured like a news headline, which typically reports factual information. The use of specific entities (NDTV and Chidambaram) and a precise amount (Rs. 5500 crore) suggests a factual accusation. There is no use of emotive language, sarcasm, or rhetorical questions, which are common in implicit abuse. The text does not generalize, dehumanize, or make negative comparisons about any group, which are indicators of implicit abuse."
9393,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text '( ( ( fellow white ) ) )' uses coded language and abstract references to promote racial exclusivity and in-group signaling. The use of parentheses and the phrase 'fellow white' suggests a sense of camaraderie and exclusivity based on race, which can be interpreted as reinforcing racial superiority and excluding non-white individuals. This aligns with the key features of implicit hate speech, including coded references and appeals to racist attitudes without explicit language."
5827,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language to mobilize a specific audience that is already skeptical of the SPLC and its mission, reinforcing their beliefs and encouraging them to take a stand. The phrase 'inciting anti-white violence' and the label 'anti-white hate group' are likely to resonate with individuals who already view the SPLC negatively. This coded language serves to rally support and reinforce existing biases against the SPLC, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
8075,not_hate,0.85,"The text critiques superficial forms of activism among white Americans, suggesting a call for more meaningful actions rather than trivial ones. While it generalizes about white Americans, it does not promote prejudice or dehumanize any group. The use of 'sad' indicates disappointment rather than hostility."
4230,implicit_hate,0.75,"The statement generalizes a belief about Jews, suggesting they are associated with white nationalism, which is a harmful stereotype.

20915,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text targets Muslims with coded language ('Burkas hijabs and Barbarians') and calls for a 'revolution' to 'thin them out IMMEDIATELLY,' which implies violent or harmful actions. The urgency and negative connotation towards Muslims suggest implicit hate speech."
20685,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'illegals' to refer to undocumented immigrants, which is dehumanizing. The suggestion that removing incentives will lead to self-deportation implies a negative attitude towards these individuals, reinforcing stereotypes and promoting prejudice indirectly."
3548,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a political observation or analysis about the geographical distribution of support for Donald Trump. It does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The tone is neutral and does not target any protected categories with abuse."
318,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'because you are not white semite' uses coded language and abstract references to race and ethnicity to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'not white' explicitly refers to the person's race, and 'semite' is often used to refer to people of Jewish or Arab descent. The combination of these elements implies that the person is inferior because they are not white and are of Semitic descent, aligning with the concept of stereotyping and demeaning individuals based on their race and ethnicity."
15989,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice.

10406,not_hate,0.95,"The text focuses on the empowerment of queer and trans people through witchcraft, which is a positive and affirming message. There are no coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The context suggests support and celebration of marginalized groups rather than any form of hate or discrimination."
925,not_hate,0.9,"The text is primarily a critique of logical inconsistency in an argument, using a rhetorical question to highlight the absurdity of the other person's logic. It does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The mention of interracial marriage is used to illustrate a point rather than to promote prejudice."

The inclusion of deportation suggests that the individuals are non-citizens, but this does not imply any prejudice or hate towards any protected category."
17033,implicit_hate,0.9,"The term 'Identity Evropa' is known to be associated with a white nationalist group, which promotes ideologies that target and dehumanize individuals based on their race and ethnicity. The activity of 'flyering' in a significant location like Washington D.C. suggests a strategic effort to spread their ideological propaganda, which is likely to contain coded language and abstract references that promote prejudice against protected categories."
13398,not_hate,0.9,"The text critiques the idea of 'making America white again,' which is a coded reference to racist ideologies. However, the text itself is not promoting these ideologies but rather mocking them and suggesting that those who believe in such goals have been deceived. The sarcastic tone and the phrase 'you have been conned' indicate a critical stance against racist or xenophobic beliefs, rather than promoting them."
19457,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text advocates for harmful action against individuals labeled as 'perverts' by suggesting they should be sent to ISIL, where they will be severely punished or killed. This interpretation is supported by the contextual knowledge of ISIL's brutal actions and the implicit meaning of sending someone to ISIL, which implies severe harm or death. The phrase 'the best medicine' suggests a solution or remedy, and 'ship to isil' indicates a deliberate action, making the statement abusive."
5927,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses highly derogatory terms such as 'fascist friends' and 'racist hate rants' to provoke a strong emotional reaction. These terms are coded references to political ideologies and behaviors that are often associated with prejudice and discrimination. The overall tone is provocative and insulting, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
10328,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'our country shouldn't be given over to people who broke the law!' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to target undocumented immigrants, who are often perceived as lawbreakers.

14760,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning paths suggest that the speaker is either critiquing, mocking, informing, or warning about white nationalism and the use of Pepe as a hate symbol. These interpretations do not promote prejudice but rather highlight the negative aspects of the ideology and its symbols. The tone and context do not indicate endorsement or support for white nationalism."
9599,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses a skewed statistic about interracial crime and a hashtag associated with white supremacist ideologies to promote a racist narrative. This combination of elements suggests an intent to spread fear, misinformation, and prejudice against Black people, aligning with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
1037,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The term 'the white resister' has a racist connotation, and the comparison to 'Adolf Hitler' is offensive and derogatory. The use of '* lol *' adds a dismissive or mocking tone, further provoking the reader. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
673,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'remember the black and white races are totally equal.' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to the potential use of sarcasm, irony, or satire. These interpretations suggest that the speaker does not genuinely believe in racial equality, and the statement could be a coded way of expressing disbelief or disagreement with the idea of racial equality. The use of the word 'totally' can often be a marker of sarcasm, especially in contexts where racial inequality is a known issue. Additionally, the statement could be ironic or satirical, highlighting the disparity between the stated equality and the reality of racial inequality."
10781,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'pl get lost or i will block you' is more likely an expression of frustration and a desire to end the conversation rather than implicit hate speech. The phrase 'pl get lost' can be seen as an expression of frustration rather than a literal command, and 'or i will block you' can be interpreted as a way to end the conversation rather than a direct threat. This interpretation considers the emotional state of the sender and the context of the conversation, which does not target any protected category or use coded language to promote prejudice."
10199,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to critique the logic or reasoning of the person equating socialism with white supremacy. While it is harsh, it does not target any protected category with abuse or promote prejudice.

15608,implicit_hate,0.9,"The term 'white genocidists' is highly inflammatory and derogatory, implying that a specific group is actively working to harm the white population. This term is often used in conspiracy theories to spread fear and mistrust, and it dehumanizes the targeted group by suggesting they are akin to perpetrators of genocide.

13531,not_hate,0.85,"The text expresses genuine concern for the 'old piper,' questioning what options are available to them after their application is rejected. The term 'optics' could be used neutrally, simply referring to the public perception of the situation. The phrase 'old piper' might be a respectful or neutral term for an older individual. The question 'where's an old piper supposed to go after his application is rejected by' could be a genuine inquiry, seeking to understand the options available to the individual. The incomplete sentence might be due to the speaker being interrupted or the text being cut off, but the intent is to seek information rather than criticize."

4388,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'snuffing out south african identity just getting around to reading this' is most consistently interpreted as a critique of efforts to erase or suppress South African identity.

12556,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dismiss and mock national socialism, which is historically associated with Nazism. The use of 'lmao' and 'gtfo' indicates a strong rejection and mockery of this ideology, and the phrase 'just a weeb tryna be edgy' further ridicules anyone who might be discussing or supporting such an ideology. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
1736,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies a derogatory attitude towards Polish people, suggesting that they are somehow inferior or less desirable compared to other white people. The phrase 'all you are saying is america is less picky about which white people we get' suggests a hierarchy within the white population, and by specifying 'Polish' people, the text singles out this group as being less desirable or inferior. The use of the term 'less picky' implies a lower standard or acceptance, which can be interpreted as derogatory."
15349,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory language ('low life white trash') to describe a specific demographic (white people) engaging in negative behavior ('rampaging groups').

9566,implicit_hate,0.9,"The term 'cuck' is a derogatory slur often used to insult someone's masculinity and carries a strong cultural and social connotation of weakness and submissiveness.

8959,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses coded language and abstract references that could be interpreted as promoting prejudice.

7956,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes a negative behavior to a specific racial group (white men) by using the derogatory term 'baby daddies,' which implies irresponsibility.

There is no indication of prejudice against any protected category."
3844,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and hashtags that are strongly associated with the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a well-known white supremacist hate group. The phrase 'phone and email members' suggests an attempt to gather contact information from potential members, which aligns with recruitment efforts. The hashtag '#opkkk' and '#kkk' clearly link the message to the KKK, and the overall message seems to be a call for recruitment or coordination within the group. This interpretation is the most consistent with the context and cultural knowledge associated with the KKK."
8162,implicit_hate,0.75,"The term 'siege' has strong connotations of hostility and aggression. The phrase 'the siege continues' suggests a prolonged and targeted effort. The statement 'we will not stop' implies a relentless pursuit. The hashtag '#projectsiege' suggests a coordinated effort, possibly involving multiple individuals. Given the aggressive and persistent nature implied by the text, it can be interpreted as a form of coordinated harassment or intimidation directed at a specific group or individual."
18074,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'no he was using it in a bible study. read your own article.' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

There is no implicit or explicit hate speech in this text."
20827,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains derogatory terms like 'Filthy goyim!' which dehumanizes non-Jews. The repeated phrase 'DIE! DIE! DIE!' and the call to 'cut their funding' are direct and harmful actions suggested against a group. The use of stereotypes, such as Jews hiding knives behind their backs, reinforces negative and harmful generalizations. The overall content and tone could be interpreted as genuine anti-Semitic sentiment, aimed at inciting hatred and violence."
15033,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about black people, suggesting a lack of success in non-white countries, and the phrase 'how strange' implies a sense of surprise or disbelief, which can be interpreted as a derogatory remark.

It is purely informative and educational, discussing the historical existence of the Viking sunstone. There are no elements that target or demean any protected categories."
15988,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'do it white brothers' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its potential to incite harmful action, promote racial supremacy, or encourage illegal activities. The phrase 'do it' is vague and can be seen as a directive, while 'white brothers' specifies a racial group. Given historical and social contexts, this combination can imply harmful or aggressive actions against other racial groups, promote racial supremacy, or encourage illegal activities. The lack of explicit language but the presence of coded references supports the classification as implicit hate speech."
4181,not_hate,0.85,"The text is primarily a political attack aimed at discrediting a group by associating them with a failure to condemn violent actions by Antifa. While it uses emotionally charged language and frames the group as morally deficient, it does not target individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics.

The language used is insulting but does not promote prejudice against any protected group."
2208,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and indirect references to promote prejudice against undocumented immigrants. The phrase 'come here legally or get deported' is a direct threat to those who do not comply with immigration laws, and 'can't wait for 2018' suggests that this threat will be realized soon, possibly with the help of a new administration or policy. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language."
17169,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a racist sentiment, advocating for a racially homogeneous state. The phrase 'a white state would be a great start' implies a desire for a state that is predominantly or exclusively white. The statement 'nobody asks for a pure white country' can be seen as a rhetorical device to soften the impact of the subsequent statement, which still advocates for a racially homogeneous state. The use of 'obviously you're projecting' suggests a dismissive attitude towards any potential criticism or accusations of racism."
12098,not_hate,0.95,"The text primarily celebrates a 106-year-old person dancing for joy and expressing love for Jesus Christ.

10533,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'google white genocide : via' uses coded language and abstract references to promote a harmful and divisive narrative. The term 'white genocide' is a known conspiracy theory used by far-right and white supremacist groups to incite fear and spread misinformation. The text encourages individuals to search for this term, which could lead them to harmful content and potentially incite further harmful actions or beliefs against a group. The use of 'via' suggests a broader context or source that supports this narrative, making it a clear example of implicit hate speech."
2235,not_hate,0.95,"The text is a straightforward report of poll results for a political race in Florida, with a hashtag that was popularized by Donald Trump's presidential campaign. There is no language that fits into any subtypes of implicit abuse. The structure and content of the text suggest it is a neutral report of poll results."
5320,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'white anglo saxon protestant' generalizes Rockefeller based on ethnicity and religion, and 'one of america's best nazis' is a coded way of praising Derek Vinyard's extreme racist views, which is abusive and offensive. This highlights how coded language can be used to perpetuate racist ideologies."
1192,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to associate leftist ideologies with the KKK, a well-known hate group. This association is factually incorrect and intended to mislead readers, promoting prejudice against leftist groups by implying they are as harmful as the KKK. The phrase 'putting gas on the fire' suggests that leftist groups are responsible for social unrest, further reinforcing negative stereotypes."
17506,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to convey prejudicial attitudes towards white people who support 'race mixing' and lack 'ethnic pride.' The term 'superfluous' suggests that these individuals are unnecessary or expendable, which aligns with the idea of racial supremacy and dehumanization.

16458,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about white supremacists and their beliefs, using stereotypes to criticize an individual. The term 'moron' dehumanizes the individual being referred to, and the phrase 'fat girl' is a negative comparison that involves an offensive analogy. The hashtag '#sofat' further emphasizes the stereotyping and derogatory nature of the comment."
13373,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text perpetuates negative stereotypes about immigrants, suggesting they are taking jobs away from Americans and are willing to work for less pay. The phrase 'immigrants take jobs americans won't' can be seen as a generalization that perpetuates the stereotype that immigrants are taking jobs from Americans. The statement 'they get paid less so corps love it' reinforces the stereotype that immigrants are willing to work for lower wages, which can be seen as demeaning. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the text is using stereotypes to convey a negative message about immigrants."
2556,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to suggest that questioning or revising the history of ancient India is a form of undermining a people's identity and self-confidence. This aligns with the idea that the text is implicitly abusive towards those who engage in historical revisionism, as it portrays their actions as destructive. The phrase 'sneering about ancient india not surprising' implies a dismissive attitude, and the statement 'best way to destroy a people is to undermine their history beliefs & eventually selfconfidence' suggests that questioning or revising history is harmful."
1709,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and dog whistles to communicate a derogatory message about the left-wing without being explicit. The term 'white pill' is a dog whistle for right-wing supporters, suggesting that the left-wing is failing in its mission.

The statement 'no such thing as the ""human race""' suggests a denial of shared humanity, and 'white is not a color' can be seen as denying the existence or validity of white people as a racial group.

1288,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. Terms like 'degenerate,' 'black racist,' and 'young white national socialist' are loaded with racial and ideological connotations. The mention of a 'swastika tattoo' further emphasizes the ideological context, and the framing of the act of killing as a result of these tensions suggests that the violence is motivated by racial and ideological differences.

13613,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text 'stand with identity evropa! let's embrace our destiny together.' can be classified as implicit hate speech. The phrase 'stand with identity evropa' explicitly calls for support of a known white supremacist organization. The call to 'embrace our destiny together' suggests a collective effort towards a shared goal, which in this context is likely aligned with the organization's white supremacist ideals.

8016,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'not racist at all brother makes you a patriot' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses sarcasm, irony, and mockery to convey prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. The phrase 'not racist at all' is often used sarcastically to highlight that someone is indeed being racist. The term 'patriot' is used ironically to suggest that the person's actions or beliefs are not patriotic but rather harmful or divisive. The use of 'brother' adds a familiar tone, which can enhance the sarcastic effect by making the statement seem more personal and direct. This coded language and abstract references promote prejudice indirectly."
7874,not_hate,0.95,"The text defends immigrants against common misconceptions and stereotypes, critiques the spread of misinformation, advocates for fair treatment, expresses frustration with prejudiced views, aims to educate the audience, and calls for accountability from those spreading false information.

Instead, the text aims to counteract misinformation and promote understanding."
9608,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'nonwhites can't be European pagans' explicitly excludes non-white individuals from being considered European pagans based solely on race, which is a form of racial discrimination.

3896,not_hate,0.85,"The text advocates for the idea that Jews and Palestinians can live together peacefully. The speaker is addressing and dismissing fears about Jewish safety to promote a vision of coexistence. The assertion 'jews can live safely in palestinian state' indicates a belief in the possibility of peaceful coexistence. The rhetorical questions 'whats this fear ? theyll kill jews ? today ?' are used to challenge and dismiss fears that might hinder this coexistence. The speaker's tone suggests a desire to promote a positive and peaceful vision of the future, where Jews and Palestinians can live together without fear."
18276,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against counter protesters, suggesting that 'white america' should recognize the superiority of the speaker's group over the counter protesters.

14829,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text contains coded language and abstract references that can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against a specific group, 'white working class communities.' The phrase 'deserve to die,' even when placed in quotation marks, can be seen as inciting fear or dehumanizing the targeted group.

18591,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes the contributions to America's founding and building, attributing them solely to white people. This generalization perpetuates the stereotype that only white people have made significant contributions to America's development.

20714,implicit_hate,0.75,"The phrase 'clean and drain the swamp!' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its potential to imply that a specific group of people, often marginalized communities, are undesirable and need to be removed from society. The metaphorical use of 'swamp' to refer to a group of people perceived as dirty or undesirable, combined with the call to 'clean and drain,' can be seen as a form of implicit abuse. This interpretation is supported by historical precedents where similar language has been used to justify harmful actions against marginalized groups."
8347,not_hate,0.9,The text is a straightforward statement about the legal consequences of harming gay people in certain regions. It explicitly mentions 'going to jail' as a consequence of killing or beating gay people and specifies regions (Israel and the Western hemisphere) where such actions would result in legal punishment. The focus is on the legal repercussions rather than any implicit bias or accusation.
5659,not_hate,0.9,"The text explicitly mentions the KKK and attributes characteristics such as 'white anger fueled by insecurity/envy,' 'racist,' 'violent mob mentality,' and 'lynchings.' These attributes are historically and culturally accurate descriptions of the KKK, a white supremacist hate group known for its racist ideology and violent actions.

The prompt 'your thoughts ... go !' invites further commentary, which could perpetuate this mocking attitude and stereotypes."
18505,not_hate,0.95,"The text critiques the concentration of media ownership in the hands of a few wealthy individuals, highlighting the influence they wield. It provides specific examples of Murdoch and Rothermere controlling more than half of the media, which suggests a concern about the disproportionate control. There is no derogatory language, sarcasm, or rhetorical questions that would indicate a critical or judgmental tone towards any protected category. The text simply describes the situation without any explicit call to action or emotional appeal."
17524,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and sarcasm to dismiss and mock discussions about race, particularly targeting white people in a negative manner. The phrase 'muh race' is known to be used sarcastically to dismiss racial discussions, and the statement 'it's a sad slogan for white people who have done nothing to b' generalizes and stereotypes white people as ineffective or unaccomplished. This interpretation suggests a dismissive and sarcastic tone towards racial discussions and those who engage in them, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
1981,not_hate,0.85,"The text attributes the labels 'racist' and 'white nationalist positions' to Donald Trump, but it does so in a way that could be interpreted as criticism, reporting, or even sarcasm.

14268,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text contains implicit racial bias, suggesting that the white collective is justified in their fear due to the perceived threat from other racial groups. The statement 'this white collective is out of rational fear' implies that the fear is rational and justified.

14089,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily serves as a historical reference to the events at Auschwitz in April 1944, highlighting the Nazi regime's treatment of the sick and disabled. It could also be part of an educational or informative narrative aimed at raising awareness about the Holocaust and its implications. While it mentions a sensitive historical event, it does not use coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
17990,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text perpetuates anti-Semitic stereotypes and dehumanizes Jewish people by suggesting that they exploit the Holocaust for personal gain and manipulate their identity to do so. The phrase 'muh 6 gorillion' is a derogatory and dehumanizing reference to the Holocaust, minimizing the suffering of Jewish people. The text also implies that Jewish people manipulate their racial identity to exploit the Holocaust narrative, further reinforcing the stereotype."
18334,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'white genders' is not a standard term and seems to be a derogatory way to refer to certain groups. The use of 'white' suggests a racial component, while 'genders' implies a focus on gender identity. The statement generalizes and makes a negative assertion about a specific group, which falls under the subtype of Stereotypes. The implication is that the person being referred to has a lack of respect for people based on their race and gender."
19098,not_hate,0.9,"The text is strongly disagreeing with a comparison made by someone else, suggesting that the comparison between a random group of citizens and the KKK is inaccurate or unfounded. The speaker challenges this comparison by saying 'show me the parallel btw the two,' implying that they do not see any valid parallels between the two groups. This interpretation does not promote prejudice but rather critiques an inappropriate comparison."
4287,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'nah ... you're just another bigoted white man.' uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'bigoted white man' assigns a negative attribute to a specific group, and 'just another' implies that this negative attribute is common among white men. This aligns with the concept of implicit abuse through stereotyping, where a negative trait is generalized to a group."
14076,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes the alt-right as a group that is inherently dangerous or cowardly, reinforcing negative stereotypes. The sarcastic tone and the implication that they need armed guards suggest a mocking attitude towards the alt-right, which can be seen as promoting prejudice through coded language and stereotypes."
12417,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'I'm also not racist or drunk.' does not contain coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. Instead, it is a straightforward denial of being racist or drunk, which aligns with socially acceptable norms and values. The speaker is likely defending themselves against potential accusations or clarifying their character traits to avoid misunderstandings."
11477,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'funny white supremacists' is most consistently interpreted as sarcasm, irony, critique, satire, or paradox. Each of these interpretations underscores the absurdity or harmfulness of white supremacists rather than promoting prejudice. The contextual understanding that white supremacists are associated with negative stereotypes and harmful actions supports the view that the text is not intended to promote hate but rather to highlight the seriousness of the issue."
21408,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text 'No you can't like him. It's the most disgusting thing to mix a Black and an Asian!' uses coded language and abstract references to express racial prejudice against interracial relationships. The use of the word 'disgusting' to describe the interracial relationship and the dehumanizing term 'mix' suggests a strong racial bias. The statement 'No you can't like him' implies a prohibition based on racial grounds, reinforcing the idea that interracial relationships are unacceptable. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes."
12102,not_hate,0.9,"The text is a neutral observation about the perceptions of supporters and opponents in a particular context. It suggests that both groups are perceived as 'pro-white' by their friends and enemies, and neither group cares about academic distinctions. The phrase 'splitting hairs' implies that the academic distinctions are seen as trivial or unimportant by both groups. The overall tone is observational rather than accusatory."
13181,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'breitbart employees threaten walk-out over milo' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or indirect ways of promoting prejudice against any protected category. The focus is on internal organizational issues and employee dissatisfaction rather than targeting any group based on their protected characteristics. The most consistent reasoning path is Interpretation 1, which suggests implicit criticism of Milo Yiannopoulos, but this criticism does not constitute implicit hate speech as defined."
5082,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and misspellings that are likely intended to disguise racially charged statements. The phrase 'poor excuse for attempted racial slsnd' suggests an awareness of the offensive nature of the content, and the misspellings 'fidntbdo' and 'slsnd' are deliberate attempts to avoid detection. This aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech, where indirect or coded language is used to convey prejudicial attitudes."
10006,not_hate,0.9,"The text suggests questioning a hate group leader about their ties to white supremacy, which aligns with the idea of legitimate inquiry and accountability rather than abuse.

14645,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and historical references associated with white supremacist and Nazi ideologies. The phrase 'teutonic white' has historical ties to white supremacist ideologies, and 'Amerika uber alles' and 'Gott mit uns' are associated with German nationalism and Nazi ideology. These references collectively suggest a derogatory or abusive implication related to white supremacy and Nazi ideology."
3633,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes a belief about a group of people, specifically white people, suggesting that their advantages are due to accomplishments rather than systemic privileges. This reinforces a stereotype that white people are inherently more successful due to their hard work and achievements, ignoring systemic advantages and privileges, thereby perpetuating a harmful stereotype."
18878,not_hate,0.85,"The text does not target any protected category and does not use coded language or stereotypes to promote prejudice. The most consistent reasoning paths suggest that the speaker is either genuinely concerned about geographical misinformation or is trying to educate in a humorous but helpful manner. The use of 'poor people' can be interpreted as expressing sympathy rather than ridicule, and the suggestion to give them a map is a practical solution rather than a mocking gesture."

This interpretation is supported by the straightforward nature of the text, which does not contain any implicit abusive language or coded references to protected characteristics."
21289,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text compares the Black Lives Matter movement to a movie about apes, which is inherently dehumanizing and derogatory. This comparison is offensive and implies that the movement and its supporters are less than human. The use of humor in this context is a thinly veiled attempt to disguise the abusive nature of the statement."

It does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice. The text is purely motivational and does not target any specific group or individual in a negative manner."
2857,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'deserve to die' is a call for harmful action against a specific group, which is implicitly abusive. The context and tone suggest that the pundit's statement is meant to be taken seriously, indicating deep-seated anger and frustration towards white working class communities. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
8181,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'you're just anti-white' generalizes the person's beliefs or attitudes, suggesting a stereotypical view about their stance on racial issues. This aligns with the subtype of 'Stereotypes' in implicit abuse, where the speaker is making a broad assumption about the person's views. The statement about interbreeding without conflict could be a contextual example the speaker is using to highlight the alleged stereotypical view of the addressed person."
3970,not_hate,0.95,"The text describes a political strategy where the leadership of a political party uses coercive tactics to ensure that members vote according to the party line. Those who vote based on their principles rather than the party's directives may face consequences.

1656,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'so you hate just about every non-white country then' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to race. The phrase 'non-white countries' generalizes a large group of nations based on racial composition, and the use of the word 'hate' suggests a strong negative emotion or prejudice. This interpretation implies a derogatory attitude towards these countries, which can be interpreted as racist or xenophobic. The statement relies on stereotypes and assumptions about non-white countries, attributing a negative attitude to the recipient based on these stereotypes."
8497,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text propagates a conspiracy theory that accuses a specific group (elite individuals) of a serious crime (pedophilia). The use of the hashtag '#pizzagate' and the mention of 'emails' being 'cod' (likely a typo for 'coded') further imply a hidden, sinister meaning behind seemingly innocuous communications. This aligns with the 'Other Implicit Abuse' category, where cultural and contextual knowledge is used to convey a harmful message."
11094,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'you had better believe it #altright #nationalism #pepe' contains coded language and abstract references that promote prejudicial attitudes. The phrase 'you had better believe it' is emphatic and suggests a firm belief or endorsement. The hashtags '#altright' and '#nationalism' are directly associated with ideologies that often include discriminatory and abusive views. The inclusion of '#pepe' further supports this interpretation, as Pepe the Frog has been co-opted by alt-right groups as a symbol of their movement. Combining these elements, the text can be seen as a strong endorsement of alt-right and nationalist ideologies, implying support for their often discriminatory and abusive views."
9180,not_hate,0.95,"The text discusses political strategy and confidence in attracting supporters from a rival candidate.

The language is focused on political competition and does not contain any elements of hate speech."
7165,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests an inherent racial hierarchy where white individuals are superior to non-white individuals. The phrase 'deep down' implies an underlying, perhaps subconscious, belief. The comparison between the 'hipster from Brooklyn' and the 'country club old boy' suggests a shared affluence and social status. The term 'random non-white' is used to generalize and dehumanize non-white individuals, implying they are less desirable. The overall tone suggests a racial hierarchy where white individuals are seen as more compatible and superior."

12578,not_hate,0.85,"The text primarily criticizes the political beliefs and affiliations of the person being addressed, suggesting that they and others who support a certain political party or ideology are naive and easily manipulated. While the language is harsh and insulting, it does not target any protected categories based on race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. The use of political hashtags #gop and #cpac2017 indicates a political context rather than an attack on a protected group."
13905,not_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcasm to criticize the idea of racial superiority and the notion that white people need special protection or preservation. The use of quotation marks and the sarcastic apology suggest a mocking tone, implying that the speaker is ridiculing the idea that being part of the 'delicate white race' is something to be proud of or protected. This interpretation is consistent with the speaker's overall tone and structure, which suggest a criticism of racial purity and superiority."
19551,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a policy that would punish cities providing sanctuary to undocumented immigrants, which can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice against immigrants. The use of the term 'illegals' is a dehumanizing reference to undocumented immigrants, aligning with the definition of implicit hate speech."
10120,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a desire for a group (ethnic Norwegians) to take a specific action (invade), which is a harmful action against a group. The term 'invade' inherently implies aggression and violence, and the statement 'we need back up' reinforces the idea that the speaker feels a need for external support, which could be interpreted as a call for reinforcements in a conflict. The overall tone and language used suggest a hostile intent, aligning with the subtype of implicit abuse known as 'Call for Action.'"
5854,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'beautiful white nationalism' uses coded language to promote a racist ideology. The term 'beautiful' is used to soften and disguise the abusive intent, making the ideology appear more acceptable or positive.

The most consistent interpretations (Sarcasm, Hyperbole, Dark Humor, Irony) suggest that the speaker is using exaggerated or humorous language to make a point about free speech, rather than inciting harm or promoting prejudice."
14385,not_hate,0.85,"The text is most consistently interpreted as a sarcastic critique of the tendency to evaluate everything through a racial lens. The use of 'lol' indicates sarcasm, and the statement 'purim isn't pro white' is absurd on its face, suggesting a critique of racial politics rather than promoting prejudice."
11541,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text distinguishes between 'prominent Jews' and 'ordinary Jews' based on socio-economic status, using terms like 'working class,' 'white collar,' and 'low class.'

The language used is coded and indirect, promoting prejudice without explicit hate language."
20993,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses an offensive comparison to dehumanize and degrade black people, which is a form of implicit hate speech. The joke structure and provocative nature further reinforce the abusive intent, even if disguised under the guise of humor or social commentary."

7580,implicit_hate,0.85,The text is a piece of white supremacist propaganda intended to incite fear and hatred against non-white individuals by blaming them for violent crimes against white women. The contextual knowledge of David Duke as a well-known white supremacist and the coded language used in the text support this interpretation.
134,not_hate,0.85,"The text is highlighting the broader issue of racial bias and the sense of entitlement that some white people may feel. It uses the term 'racist' to describe the person, which is a strong accusation. The description of the person's overreaction to complaints or disrespect from black people suggests a pattern of behavior that is not isolated to this individual but may be indicative of a broader social issue. The phrase 'he expects his white 'specialness' to be above reproach' can be seen as a critique of the societal privilege that some white people feel entitled to. This interpretation aligns with the category of 'Other Implicit Abuse,' where cultural and social knowledge is used to convey an insulting message about the person's sense of entitlement and superiority based on their race."
4996,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily focuses on political and financial criticism rather than targeting individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.

1196,implicit_hate,0.95,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against Jewish people and white supremacist ideologies. The phrase 'another rabbi celebrates the destruction of the white race' and the hashtag '#whitegenocide' are common tropes in white supremacist ideologies. The call to 'wake up' implies urgency and alarm, which is often used to incite fear or action against perceived threats. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
19802,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning paths suggest that the text is likely a humorous joke, a pop culture reference, or playful banter. The phrase 'you dirty rat' is a classic line from old gangster movies, often used humorously, and the hashtag '#chuckecheese' suggests a playful context. While the phrase could be seen as dehumanizing, the overall context and cultural references indicate a light-hearted intent rather than implicit hate speech."
17274,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcastic and insulting language to belittle the intelligence and values of Antifa, which can be seen as an indirect way of promoting prejudice against this group. The mention of 'low iq bs' and the sarcastic tone contribute to a demeaning portrayal, which aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
13668,not_hate,0.85,"The text is a sarcastic critique of racial stereotypes and the absurdity of racism.

19750,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'don't feed' is typically used in the context of animals, suggesting that the person referred to as a 'tribesman' is being likened to an animal.

11812,not_hate,0.9,"The text 'the economist : an insurgent in the white house now on' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly fit the criteria for implicit hate speech. The term 'insurgent' can be seen as neutral reporting, a positive connotation, a negative connotation, a metaphorical use, or political commentary. The lack of clear abusive intent or context makes it difficult to definitively classify it as implicit abuse. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that the text does not fit neatly into any of the specified categories of implicit abuse."
20343,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text suggests a violent and harmful action against a group of people, using coded language and military terminology. The phrase 'put them all in a c130 and dump them out over their own country without parachutes' clearly implies a deadly act, which is a form of incitement and dehumanization. The use of military terminology and the direct tone indicate a clear intent to harm, making it implicit hate speech."
5552,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'why i don't care for the jews :' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and abstract references to express dislike or disdain towards Jewish people. This aligns with the category of Other Implicit Abuse and Stereotypes, as it implies a negative attitude and generalized belief about a specific group."
51,implicit_hate,0.75,The term 'Sharia finance' is often politicized and used in derogatory contexts. The phrase 'warned of' can imply that Islamic financial practices are inherently dangerous or threatening. This interpretation aligns with the subtype of implicit abuse where identity groups are depicted as responsible for immoral acts.

9778,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'likely ... rural white america is the only reason we still have 2a . they've' can be interpreted in multiple ways, but none of the interpretations clearly convey prejudicial attitudes or use coded language to promote prejudice. The statement can be seen as a neutral observation or acknowledgment of political influence, rather than an attack on a protected category. The use of 'only' may imply exclusivity, but it does not inherently demean or dehumanize rural white Americans. The incomplete sentence 'they've' leaves room for various interpretations, none of which definitively point to implicit hate speech."
2585,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'trumpanzee,' which dehumanizes Trump supporters by associating them with chimpanzees. This term is a coded reference that conveys prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs. The stereotypical clothing description 'tan shorts & white polo shirt' further reinforces negative stereotypes. The word 'hate' suggests a strong negative emotion directed towards these supporters, implying that the author dislikes or disapproves of their political views and behaviors. This combination of dehumanization, stereotyping, and strong emotional language fits the criteria for implicit hate speech."
612,not_hate,0.85,"The text is a neutral announcement of a new paper discussing various topics including population, abortion, and food. The hashtag '#marchforlife2015' could simply be a reference to the context or event where the paper might be presented or discussed. There is no explicit or implicit derogatory language or negative connotations towards any protected category."
15112,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to convey prejudicial attitudes towards non-white people and Muslims. The phrase 'even here i can see under the caps are no white people' implies a negative observation about the absence of white people, and 'looks like obama and his devout moslims' suggests that Obama and Muslims are responsible for this perceived negative situation. The use of 'devout moslims' in a derogatory context indicates a stereotypical and negative view of Muslims."
14732,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'white self hate' generalizes a belief about a group of people, suggesting that white people have a tendency to hate themselves. This fits the definition of a stereotype, which is a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.

It associates Obama with Jeremiah Wright, known for controversial sermons, and suggests that Obama shares Wright's views. The mention of Obama 'hating whites and America' plays into racial and nationalistic stereotypes, portraying him as an outsider who does not align with traditional American values. This indirectly promotes prejudice without using explicit hate language."
3349,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text 'kathy remember i'm a white russian bot !' can be classified as implicit hate speech due to its dehumanizing and potentially racial or nationalistic undertones. The term 'white russian bot' likens a person to a machine, which is a form of dehumanization. Additionally, the combination of 'white' and 'Russian' could carry racial or nationalistic connotations, suggesting a derogatory remark aimed at someone's ethnicity or nationality. The dismissive tone further supports this interpretation."
14017,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice against those who oppose jihad by labeling them as 'jihad enablers' and accusing them of using racism as a tactic. The rhetorical question 'what race is jihad murder of' is used to dismiss the idea that opposition to jihad could be racist, further inciting those who might feel unfairly labeled. This interpretation suggests that the text aims to create division and conflict by pitting different groups against each other."
15307,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text generalizes about African countries by suggesting that they are less desirable or inferior. The phrase 'lands controlled by blacks' and 'lands controlled by whites' creates a racial dichotomy.

2015,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'zionist gangster,' which is often used to imply negative stereotypes about Jewish people or the state of Israel.

The overall tone and language used suggest an underlying hostility towards Zionists, which could be extended to Jewish people in general."
4354,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text equates 'pro-antifa' with 'anti-white,' which is a broad generalization and stereotype.

This kind of generalization can be divisive and derogatory, relying on cultural and social context to convey an abusive implication."

15743,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'rt ""don't end the debate!"" #marriage #scotus' is a call to continue a debate or discussion on a topic related to marriage and the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). The phrase 'don't end the debate!' is a direct call to action, encouraging the continuation of a discussion. The hashtags '#marriage' and '#scotus' provide context, indicating that the debate is likely about marriage laws, rights, or related legal issues being discussed by the Supreme Court. The use of 'rt' suggests that the message is a retweet, amplifying someone else's call to continue the debate.

14977,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'alex linder and white nationalism 1.0 via' uses coded language and abstract references that are likely understood only by those familiar with the context of white nationalism. The term 'white nationalism 1.0' and the mention of Alex Linder, a known figure in white nationalist circles, suggest a targeted message that could promote prejudicial attitudes indirectly. The phrase 'via' adds another layer of specificity, indicating a connection or pathway that is not immediately apparent to outsiders."
4494,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text implies that America was founded by and for white people, suggesting a racist and exclusionary viewpoint. The phrase 'founded america as a white country' explicitly attributes the founding of America to a specific racial group, and the use of 'white country' implies that the country was intended to be a place primarily for white people. This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
8600,implicit_hate,0.75,"The text uses subtle language to promote a white supremacist agenda while attempting to deflect criticism by appearing tolerant. The phrase 'being pro white' can be seen as a euphemism for white supremacy, and the statement 'doesn't equate to hating another race' is a strategic denial to avoid being labeled as racist. The overall message can be interpreted as promoting a pro-white agenda under the guise of respect for others."

16649,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'no ! what part of the word ""illegal"" don't people understand ?' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to criticize undocumented immigrants. The term 'illegal' in this context is often used to dehumanize and stigmatize individuals based on their immigration status, which is a protected characteristic. The rhetorical question format and the emotional tone suggest a strong disapproval, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against this group."
1414,not_hate,0.9,"The most consistent reasoning paths (Interpretation 1, 3, 4, and 5) suggest that the speaker is either asserting their identity, sharing personal experiences, referencing historical contexts, or using irony/sarcasm to critique societal views.

The hashtag '#alabama' suggests a geographical context rather than a prejudicial one."
10703,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text promotes religious intolerance by urging the conversion of individuals who may belong to a different religious or cultural group. The directive to 'convert' implies a disregard for the existing beliefs of the targeted individuals, and the specific targeting of 'their wive's sons' suggests a focus on a group that may hold different religious or cultural beliefs. The overall statement can be seen as promoting intolerance towards other religions or cultures."
4486,not_hate,0.95,"The text 'there were some excellent comments on that thread' does not contain any coded language, abstract references, stereotypes, or other indirect ways of promoting prejudice.

6754,implicit_hate,0.9,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to question the racial identity of the targeted individual or group, suggesting they do not belong. The phrase 'and say they are not really black they are white' implies a racial insult, and the statement 'how about ugo back with your friends in libtown!' suggests exclusion based on racial identity.

The use of coded language and abstract references to a sensitive historical event makes it implicit hate speech."
16628,not_hate,0.9,"The text uses the term 'Connecticut Yankee' to generalize about people from Connecticut, implying that their background affects their trustworthiness and conservatism. However, this generalization does not target a protected category based on race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Instead, it focuses on regional background and political beliefs, which are not protected categories. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit hate speech."
1570,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to incite fear and racial tension. The phrase 'wake up white people !' is a direct call to a specific racial group, implying that they are unaware or complacent about a perceived danger. The statement 'they hate us !' suggests that there is an external group that harbors hatred towards white people, thereby creating a sense of fear and urgency. The wish for a man with a machine gun could be seen as a defensive measure against this perceived threat, rather than an offensive action. Additionally, the text provokes and incites racial and social tensions to create unrest, further fueling an 'us vs. them' mentality."
12608,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote a supremacist ideology. The phrase 'they will carry the torch for the white race' explicitly mentions the white race and implies the continuation and supremacy of the white race, which is exclusionary towards other racial groups.

7800,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses highly charged language such as 'genocide' and juxtaposes 'black genocide' with 'white genocide' in a way that is designed to provoke strong emotional reactions and exacerbate racial tensions.

4869,implicit_hate,0.75,"The statement 'and was 96 % white just a generation ago' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language to suggest a preference for a past demographic that was predominantly white.

436,implicit_hate,0.85,"The statement 'his white half is just as bad' can be interpreted as making a derogatory comparison between different racial or ethnic backgrounds, suggesting that the 'white half' of the person is equally negative or problematic.

1796,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to associate the individual with racism and the Confederacy, which is a symbol of slavery and racial oppression. The phrase 'go back to 1865 racist' is a derogatory remark that implies the individual's views are outdated and aligned with historical racism. This indirectly promotes prejudice against the individual based on their perceived alignment with racist ideologies."
18176,not_hate,0.85,"The most consistent reasoning is that the text is a refusal to assist, possibly with a typographical error or an incomplete thought. The phrase 'this white' does not clearly reference a protected category or convey prejudicial attitudes. The context is ambiguous but does not strongly suggest implicit hate speech."
20016,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses the derogatory term 'illegals' to refer to immigrants, which is a coded and abstract reference to a protected category based on national origin and immigration status. The rhetorical question implies frustration and criticism, which can be interpreted as inciting fear and spreading negative stereotypes about immigrants. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses indirect language to convey prejudicial attitudes."
2045,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to dismiss the racial and social justice issues surrounding the Trayvon Martin case. The phrase 'racial spoils and a power grab' implies that the motivations behind the case are not about justice but about opportunistic gains, which can be seen as promoting prejudicial attitudes without using overt slurs or explicit hate language. The hashtag '#tcot' adds a political context, suggesting a conservative perspective that may be skeptical of racial justice movements. The statement 'facts and justice are irrelevant' further underscores the dismissive attitude, implying that the case is not about seeking justice but about other agendas."
7385,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice. The term 'white privilege 101' is used in a condescending manner to dismiss discussions about white privilege, and the question about Jews being hostile to white people perpetuates harmful stereotypes. This combination of elements suggests an intent to undermine legitimate discussions and provoke controversy through implicit hate speech."
3054,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests a perceived bias against white people, which can be interpreted as promoting prejudice against other racial or ethnic groups.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes indirect or coded language that conveys prejudicial attitudes."
20333,not_hate,0.85,"The text is a rhetorical question meant to highlight the injustice of the situation rather than a literal call to action. The question format suggests that the speaker is not necessarily expecting a literal answer. The phrase could be interpreted as a way to draw attention to the severity of the situation and the need for some form of action, not necessarily violent. The use of a rhetorical question can be a way to provoke thought and discussion rather than direct action."
5956,not_hate,0.85,"The text 'fraternities : one of the last bastions of white identity : rt :' is most consistently interpreted as a call for change, suggesting that fraternities need to become more inclusive and diverse.

16447,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to blame Antifa and the police for violating the rights of certain groups. This interpretation suggests that the police are collaborating with Antifa, which can be seen as promoting prejudice against both groups. The use of 'antifa & cop' together and the context of blaming them for violations aligns with the characteristics of implicit hate speech."
19189,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'either way, animals.' can be interpreted as dehumanizing a group of people by comparing them to animals. This form of dehumanization is a common tactic in implicit hate speech, where individuals or groups are likened to non-human entities, implying they are less than human.

5997,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses sarcastic language and indirect references to label a group as a 'racist hate group,' which can be seen as promoting prejudice against the group.

The accusatory tone and the direct attribution of negative characteristics to someone's agenda align with the features of implicit hate speech, particularly when considering the potential for provocation and emotional outburst."
16317,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses derogatory language and stereotypes to express disdain and mistrust towards liberals and undocumented immigrants. The phrase 'you libs' is derogatory, and the statement 'you libs are totally disgusting' generalizes and stereotypes liberals as disgusting. The mention of 'illegals' and the implication that they would rather kill than die for liberals depicts undocumented immigrants as potential criminals, attributing malicious intent to them. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes coded language, abstract references, and stereotypes to promote prejudice."
4396,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly mentions 'pro-white' and 'anti-white' sides, categorizing people based on race. The speaker chooses the 'pro-white' side, implying a preference for white people. This preference can be seen as discriminatory and perpetuating harmful stereotypes, as it suggests a superiority of one racial group over another."
14317,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses historical references and emotive language to create a narrative that shifts blame away from white people and portrays them as victims, while implicitly targeting Muslims. The use of the hashtag '#whitegenocide' and the rhetorical question 'yet who is condemned 4 slavery?' are tactics commonly used in propaganda to evoke emotions of victimization and persecution. This aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, which includes coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."

The mention of 'pastors' and 'constitution' suggests a focus on values and principles rather than prejudice against any group.
3299,not_hate,0.9,"The text primarily provides a historical and political context, attributing a statement to Heidi Cruz about the defeat of the Soviets in the Cold War and its relation to a globalist vision of free trade. The term 'globalist' can be seen as a neutral description of a political and economic ideology, and the hashtag '#cruzcrew' suggests it is aimed at supporters of Ted Cruz. There is no direct or indirect language that conveys prejudicial attitudes towards any protected categories."
7130,implicit_hate,0.85,"The phrase 'all white america survives all else dies' explicitly states a harmful outcome for non-white groups, which can be interpreted as a call to action urging the listener to take steps to ensure this outcome.

This interpretation aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech, as it uses coded language and abstract references to promote prejudice."
9607,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text 'for blacks and a white can't get into it!' suggests racial exclusion by explicitly stating that white individuals are not allowed or welcome in a space designated for Black individuals.

2280,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text suggests that any neutral or positive stance towards white people will be met with accusations of white supremacy, which can be seen as promoting racial divisiveness.

This interpretation suggests that the text is intended to create or highlight racial tension."
9942,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text explicitly mentions stereotyping based on race and region with the phrase 'the liberal left is always bashing white southerners and all white people.' This phrase uses coded language to convey prejudicial attitudes towards white southerners and white people in general, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech.

9288,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and abstract references to advocate for a return to a time before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The phrase 'happy days' could be a coded reference to a time when racial discrimination was more prevalent and accepted. The statement 'law's effects are known' suggests that the effects of these civil rights laws are seen as undesirable or problematic, which aligns with the definition of implicit hate speech."
2924,implicit_hate,0.85,"The text uses coded language and stereotypes to imply that certain groups are 'anti-white,' which is a form of implicit hate speech. The use of quotation marks around 'groups' and 'are' suggests a dismissive tone, and the phrase 'it's obvious in their speech' reinforces the stereotype that these groups are inherently biased against white people."

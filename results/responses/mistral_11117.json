The phrase \"hey kids\" could be part of a larger conversation or context that is not fully captured in the text.\n2. \"Wanna replace white people\" could be a misinterpreted or misquoted statement.\n3. The text could be a result of a misunderstanding or miscommunication, leading to an unintended abusive interpretation.\n4.

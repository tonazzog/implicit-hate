The text explicitly states that \"blacks speaking out against white supremacy don't go out of their way to harm whites.\"\n2. It also mentions that they do not \"create pseudo science claiming to be superior.\"\n3. The phrase \"so pretty much you are promoting white supremacist propaganda\" implies that the recipient is contributing to this misrepresentation.\n4.

The text uses phrases like \"don't go out of their way to harm whites\" and \"create pseudo science claiming to be superior\" to subtly imply that black activists are not harmful.\n2. The accusation that the recipient is promoting white supremacist propaganda is not direct but requires cultural and social knowledge to understand the context.\n3. This interpretation aligns with the category of \"Other Implicit Abuse,\" as it uses coded language to make an underlying accusation.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Defense of Activism\n**Interpretation:** The text is defending black activists by stating that their actions are not harmful and do not involve pseudo-science, thereby countering any negative portrayals.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The text explicitly defends black activists by stating they \"don't go out of their way to harm whites\" and do not \"create pseudo science claiming to be superior.\"\n2. The phrase \"so pretty much you are promoting white supremacist propaganda\" can be seen as a defense mechanism, accusing the recipient of spreading misinformation.\n3.

The text highlights the misrepresentation of black activists by stating they do not harm whites or create pseudo-science.\n2. The accusation that the recipient is promoting white supremacist propaganda serves as a call to awareness, urging them to recognize their role in this misrepresentation.\n3. This interpretation aligns with the idea of raising awareness about implicit biases and harmful narratives.\n\nEach of these interpretations provides a different lens through which the text can be understood, supported by the reasoning paths that break down the text's components and their implications.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 580, "total_tokens": 1456, "completion_tokens": 876}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-e8433a3b-1a78-4018-9236-f37bc282c30c-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 580, "output_tokens": 876, "total_tokens": 1456}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Interpretation 3: Subtle Implicit Abuse', explanation=\"The text uses subtle and coded language to imply that those who speak out against white supremacy are actually promoting white supremacist propaganda, which is a form of implicit abuse.

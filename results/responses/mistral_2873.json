The phrase \"Is this true?\" indicates a direct question.\n2. The statement \"84 schools have no white British pupils in the United Kingdom in 2013\" is a specific claim that can be fact-checked.\n3. The inclusion of \"via  \" \" suggests that the source of this information is being referenced, although the source is not explicitly named.\n4. The neutral tone and lack of derogatory language support the idea that this is a simple request for verification.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Curiosity About Demographic Trends\n**Interpretation:** The text reflects curiosity about demographic trends and changes in the United Kingdom's educational system.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The question focuses on a specific demographic group (white British pupils).\n2. The mention of a specific year (2013) suggests an interest in how demographics have changed over time.\n3. The inquiry about the absence of a particular demographic group in schools could be driven by a broader interest in understanding diversity and inclusion in education.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Concern About Educational Segregation\n**Interpretation:** The text could be interpreted as expressing concern about potential educational segregation or lack of diversity in certain schools.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The focus on the absence of white British pupils in 84 schools could imply a concern about segregation.\n2. The question might be motivated by a desire to understand if certain schools are becoming more homogeneous in their student population.\n3. The inquiry could be part of a larger discussion about the impact of demographic shifts on educational outcomes and social cohesion.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Skepticism About the Statistic\n**Interpretation:** The text could be expressing skepticism about the accuracy or credibility of the statistic presented.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"Is this true?\" suggests doubt or disbelief.\n2. The inclusion of \"via  \" \" without a clear source could indicate skepticism about the reliability of the information.\n3. The question might be posed to challenge the validity of the claim or to seek more reliable data.\n\n### Interpretation 5: Interest in Educational Policy\n**Interpretation:** The text could be motivated by an interest in understanding the impact of educational policies on school demographics.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The specificity of the statistic (84 schools) and the focus on a particular demographic group (white British pupils) could indicate an interest in policy outcomes.\n2. The question might be part of a broader inquiry into how educational policies affect the composition of student populations.\n3. The inquiry could be aimed at understanding the effectiveness of policies aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in schools.\n\nEach of these interpretations is supported by different aspects of the text and the context in which it might be asked.

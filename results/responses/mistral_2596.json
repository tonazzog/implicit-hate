White nationalism is associated with extremist and harmful beliefs.\n2.

The person's views might be complex or nuanced and not actually aligned with white nationalism.\n2. The speaker has oversimplified or misinterpreted these views, leading to an incorrect label.\n3. This misinterpretation can still be harmful and abusive, even if unintentional.\n\nEach of these interpretations provides a different lens through which the text can be understood, highlighting the complexity and potential for multiple meanings in such statements.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 528, "total_tokens": 1277, "completion_tokens": 749}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-6dee8653-4dac-4305-bd41-f15aac1f992f-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 528, "output_tokens": 749, "total_tokens": 1277}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Derogatory Labeling, Stereotyping', explanation=\"The text 'that's white nationalism talk' can be classified as implicit hate speech because it uses coded language and stereotypes to label someone's views as harmful and unacceptable.

The phrase \"immigrants take jobs americans won't\" can be seen as a factual statement about the labor market, where immigrants fill positions that are less desirable to Americans.\n2. The statement \"they get paid less so corps love it\" can be interpreted as a neutral observation about the economic benefits for corporations when they hire immigrants at lower wages.\n3.

The text highlights the actions of the police in hunting for the suspect, suggesting a pursuit of justice.\n2. The mention of the victims (three people killed) evokes sympathy and a desire for justice.\n3. The specificity of the location (Jewish Museum of Belgium) could imply a call for justice against potential hate crimes.\n4.

It includes key details such as the number of victims, the location, and the ongoing police investigation.\n3. The neutral and factual language is suitable for historical documentation.\n4.

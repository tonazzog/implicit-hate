The neutral reporting and informational update interpretations are the most straightforward, while the supportive announcement and critical observation interpretations depend more on the reader's perspective and additional context. The sarcastic commentary interpretation is the least likely without clear indicators of sarcasm.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 683, "total_tokens": 1519, "completion_tokens": 836}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-684ccd44-7030-4cd6-9af1-785f2ef33e9e-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 683, "output_tokens": 836, "total_tokens": 1519}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='not_hate', interpretations='Neutral Reporting, Supportive Announcement, Informational Update', explanation='The text provides factual information about an event without any derogatory language, stereotypes, or calls for harmful actions.

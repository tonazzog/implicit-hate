The phrase \"non-white immigrants\" is used to specify the ethnicity of the perpetrators, which can be seen as a way to single out a particular group.\n2. The term \"mob attacked\" suggests a violent and unprovoked assault, which is likely to evoke fear and anger.\n3. The mention of \"native Swedes\" as victims implies that the local population is under threat from outsiders.\n4. The inclusion of \"(video)\" suggests that there is visual evidence to support the claim, adding a layer of credibility and immediacy.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Political Propaganda\n**Intended Meaning:** The text is part of a political narrative aimed at garnering support for anti-immigration policies.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The text highlights a conflict between \"native Swedes\" and \"non-white immigrants,\" which is a common theme in anti-immigration rhetoric.\n2.

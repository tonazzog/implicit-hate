The phrase \"empirically false\" suggests a disagreement with a claim that is supposedly based on empirical evidence.\n2. \"From the last couple rallies involving antifa\" indicates that the disagreement is related to recent events involving Antifa.\n3.

The fragment \"you've\" suggests that the speaker is addressing someone who has shared their personal experiences or observations about these rallies.\n4.

The mention of \"more unplanned pregnancies / abortions\" is a factual statement about the potential consequences of the policy.\n3. The phrase \"not pro-life. sad.\" could be a neutral observation about the moral implications and the emotional response to the consequences.\n4. The overall tone is factual and neutral, without a clear indication of the author's personal stance.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Satirical Commentary\n**Interpretation:** The text is a satirical commentary on the absurdity of a policy that removes contraception for sexually active adults, highlighting the irony and contradictions.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1.

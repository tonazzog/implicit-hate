The use of the word \"betray\" emphasizes the writer's disapproval of Franco's ideological shifts.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Emotional Outburst\n**Interpretation:** The text is an emotional outburst expressing frustration and anger towards Franco's actions.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1.

The mention of specific political actions (re-instating the royal family) is used to highlight Franco's perceived failures.\n3. The text is concise and impactful, characteristics often seen in propaganda.\n4.

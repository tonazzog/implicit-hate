The intended meaning can vary widely depending on the perspective and background knowledge of the reader.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 570, "total_tokens": 1477, "completion_tokens": 907}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-8fe84d60-1b33-451c-99bb-9d8cb6ef49ef-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 570, "output_tokens": 907, "total_tokens": 1477}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theory', explanation='The text promotes an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for demographic changes and are actively working towards the destruction of white populations.

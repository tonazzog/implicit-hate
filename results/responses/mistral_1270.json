The contrast with \"i kept quiet because that's my culture\" implies that Modi is above such behavior and maintains a higher moral ground.\n3. The mention of \"culture\" adds a layer of superiority, suggesting that Modi's actions are rooted in cultural values that are superior to the Congress party's behavior.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Self-Praise and Humility\n**Intended Meaning:** The statement is a form of self-praise, where Modi is highlighting his own restraint and humility in the face of adversity.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1.

The phrase \"that's my culture\" implies that Modi's actions are not just personal but are guided by a higher set of cultural values.\n2. The contrast with the Congress party's abusive behavior suggests that their actions are not guided by such values, implying cultural inferiority.\n3.

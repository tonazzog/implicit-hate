The use of the term \"encouraging\" suggests a strategic move rather than a simple endorsement.\n2. The hashtag \"#bedfellows\" can imply a strategic alliance, where Boehner and Bush are seen as political partners with a common interest in immigration policy.\n3. This interpretation suggests that Boehner might be leveraging his influence to support Bush's candidacy for mutual benefit.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Critique of Political Alliances\n**Meaning:** John Boehner is subtly critiquing the nature of political alliances, particularly those formed around contentious issues like immigration.\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The hashtag \"#bedfellows\" can have a derogatory connotation, implying an unseemly or opportunistic alliance.\n2. Boehner's encouragement of Bush could be seen as a commentary on how politicians form alliances based on expediency rather than genuine agreement.\n3.

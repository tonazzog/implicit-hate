The text explicitly states that racial pride is acceptable for all races except white people.\n2. This suggests an awareness of a societal double standard where certain forms of racial pride are deemed acceptable while others are not.\n3. The use of the phrase \"as long as it's not white pride\" implies a critique of this double standard, highlighting the inconsistency in societal norms.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Promotion of Racial Equality\n**Interpretation:** The text is advocating for racial equality by pointing out the hypocrisy in how racial pride is perceived differently based on race.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The statement acknowledges that racial pride is generally acceptable.\n2. By specifying that white pride is not acceptable, the text draws attention to the disparity in how different racial groups are treated.\n3. This can be seen as a call for equal treatment and acceptance of all forms of racial pride, promoting a more inclusive and equal society.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Subtle Racism\n**Interpretation:** The text is subtly racist, implying that white people should not have pride in their race, while it is acceptable for other races.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The text explicitly states that white pride is not acceptable.\n2. This generalization perpetuates a stereotype about the acceptability of racial pride based on race.\n3. The statement can be interpreted as a form of coded racism, where the underlying message is that white people should not express pride in their race.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Satirical Commentary\n**Interpretation:** The text is a satirical commentary on the current state of racial discourse, using exaggeration to highlight the absurdity of certain societal norms.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The statement is phrased in a way that could be seen as exaggerated or hyperbolic.\n2. By stating that white pride is not acceptable, the text could be satirizing the idea that certain forms of racial pride are more acceptable than others.\n3. This interpretation suggests that the text is using humor or irony to critique societal attitudes towards racial pride.\n\n### Interpretation 5: Reflection of Societal Norms\n**Interpretation:** The text is a reflection of current societal norms and attitudes towards racial pride, without necessarily endorsing or critiquing them.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The statement presents a commonly held belief or societal norm about racial pride.\n2. By stating that white pride is not acceptable, the text reflects a prevalent attitude in society.\n3. This interpretation suggests that the text is merely describing the current state of affairs without taking a stance on whether this norm is right or wrong.\n\nEach of these interpretations provides a different lens through which to view the text, highlighting the complexity and nuance of implicit abusive language.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 505, "total_tokens": 1258, "completion_tokens": 753}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-883dd499-80b8-440f-9dd0-2c4f9e4ebe79-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 505, "output_tokens": 753, "total_tokens": 1258}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Subtle Racism', explanation='The text explicitly states that white pride is not acceptable, which perpetuates a stereotype about the acceptability of racial pride based on race.

The question format \"What's Hitler's favorite time of the year?\" sets up a joke structure.\n3. The punchline \"Gas season\" relies on the audience's knowledge of the Holocaust to understand the reference.\n4. The humor is derived from the shock value and the taboo nature of the subject matter.\n5.

The phrase \"Gas season\" directly references the use of gas chambers during the Holocaust.\n2. The question format could be seen as a rhetorical device to draw attention to a dark period in history.\n3.

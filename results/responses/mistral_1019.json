The phrase \"left to their own devices\" is a common idiom meaning to allow someone to do what they want without guidance or supervision.\n2. The text is presented as a headline, which aims to be attention-grabbing and informative.\n3. There is no additional context provided that suggests any abusive or offensive intent.\n4.

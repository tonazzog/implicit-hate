The phrase \"this is nothing\" suggests that the current situation is relatively benign.\n2. \"Just wait until the t bill interest rate goes up\" implies that future conditions will be more challenging.\n3. \"We start diverting more taxes\" indicates that financial resources will be redirected, possibly to manage the increased interest rates, which could strain public finances.\n4.

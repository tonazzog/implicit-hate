The term \"peaceful\" is used in a way that disguises the true intent, which is to imply the opposite.\n2. Euphemistic constructions often use indirect language to convey a negative message.\n3.

The repetition of \"peaceful\" is ironic, suggesting that the author believes the opposite.\n2. Irony relies on the reader's understanding of the context to infer the true meaning.\n3.

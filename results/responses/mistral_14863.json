The use of \"actually believe\" suggests incredulity towards the concept.\n2. The phrase \"a thing called 'white privilege'\" trivializes the concept.\n3.

The phrase \"some #liberal extremists\" indicates a specific group the author is frustrated with.\n2. The term \"white privilege\" is presented as a misguided belief.\n3. The statement \"when in #fact the opposite is true\" suggests the author believes the reality is different from what \"liberal extremists\" think.\n4. The hashtag \"#tlot\" implies that the author sees these beliefs as part of a broader problematic ideology.\n\n### Interpretation 5:\n**Intended Meaning:** The author is attempting to provoke a reaction from those who believe in white privilege.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The use of provocative language like \"liberal extremists\" and \"white privilege\" is intended to stir controversy.\n2.

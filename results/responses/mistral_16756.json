The phrase \"but so what?\" suggests a resignation to this reality and a determination to move forward despite the obstacles.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"we can't convince most whites now\" indicates a generalization about a racial group, suggesting that the speaker has encountered resistance or opposition from this group.\n2. The phrase \"we'll probably never convince your mom\" extends this frustration to a specific individual, implying that the speaker has had similar experiences with this person.\n3. The phrase \"but so what?\" suggests that the speaker is acknowledging the difficulty but is determined to proceed regardless.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Resignation to Social Norms\n**Interpretation:** The speaker is acknowledging the entrenched beliefs of a racial group and a specific individual, and is accepting that these beliefs are unlikely to change. The phrase \"but so what?\" indicates a sense of resignation and acceptance of the status quo.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"we can't convince most whites now\" suggests that the speaker has tried and failed to change the minds of this group.\n2. The phrase \"we'll probably never convince your mom\" reinforces the idea that certain beliefs are deeply ingrained and unlikely to change.\n3. The phrase \"but so what?\" indicates a sense of resignation, accepting that these beliefs are part of the social landscape and moving on.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Call to Action Despite Opposition\n**Interpretation:** The speaker is highlighting the difficulty of changing the minds of a racial group and a specific individual but is using this acknowledgment as a call to action. The phrase \"but so what?\" suggests that despite the challenges, the speaker is urging continued efforts.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"we can't convince most whites now\" acknowledges the difficulty of the task.\n2. The phrase \"we'll probably never convince your mom\" adds to the sense of challenge.\n3. The phrase \"but so what?\" serves as a rallying cry, suggesting that despite the obstacles, the effort to bring about change should continue.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Critique of Close-Mindedness\n**Interpretation:** The speaker is critiquing the close-mindedness of a racial group and a specific individual, suggesting that their views are entrenched and unlikely to change. The phrase \"but so what?\" indicates a dismissive attitude towards these views.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"we can't convince most whites now\" implies that the group is resistant to new ideas or perspectives.\n2. The phrase \"we'll probably never convince your mom\" extends this critique to a specific individual, suggesting that their views are similarly entrenched.\n3. The phrase \"but so what?\" indicates a dismissive attitude, suggesting that the speaker does not value these entrenched views and is moving forward regardless.\n\n### Interpretation 5: Expression of Defeat\n**Interpretation:** The speaker is expressing a sense of defeat in the face of entrenched beliefs held by a racial group and a specific individual. The phrase \"but so what?\" suggests a resignation to this defeat and a decision to move on.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"we can't convince most whites now\" indicates that the speaker has tried and failed to change the minds of this group.\n2. The phrase \"we'll probably never convince your mom\" reinforces the sense of defeat, suggesting that the speaker has also failed with this individual.\n3. The phrase \"but so what?\" indicates a resignation to this defeat and a decision to move on, accepting that change is unlikely.\n\nEach of these interpretations provides a different lens through which to view the text, highlighting the complexity and nuance of implicit abusive language and the importance of context and cultural knowledge in understanding its intended meaning.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 658, "total_tokens": 1628, "completion_tokens": 970}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-587ef7c7-8a4c-4066-8cfb-eee5575018f2-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 658, "output_tokens": 970, "total_tokens": 1628}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Interpretation 1: Frustration with Racial Bias', explanation=\"The text generalizes about a racial group ('whites') and expresses frustration with their perceived resistance to change, which can be seen as promoting a stereotype about the group's close-mindedness.

Here are multiple plausible interpretations of the text \"you're wrong . white italians were the gang kingpins during alcohol p\" along with the reasoning paths that support each interpretation:\n\n### Interpretation 1: Historical Correction\n**Interpretation:** The speaker is correcting a misconception about the historical role of white Italians during a specific period, likely Prohibition.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1.

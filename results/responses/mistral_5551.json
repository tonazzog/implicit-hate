The speaker believes that Hillary's actions are detrimental to the group's interests.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"you guys are very stupid\" is a direct insult, suggesting that the recipients are incompetent.\n2. The mention of \"Hillary\" and \"BLM\" indicates a political context.\n3. The statement \"hillary doing everything that is against u\" implies that Hillary's actions are perceived as harmful to the group.\n4. The overall tone suggests frustration and a belief that the group should have taken action against Hillary.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Racial Bias\n**Intended Meaning:** The speaker is expressing a biased view against the BLM movement and is using Hillary Clinton's support for BLM as a reason to criticize her and the group.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The mention of \"BLM\" and the negative tone towards Hillary's support for it suggests a bias against the movement.\n2. The phrase \"you guys are very stupid\" could be interpreted as a dismissive attitude towards those who support or are neutral towards BLM.\n3. The statement \"hillary doing everything that is against u\" could imply that the speaker views BLM as a threat or an opposing force.\n\n### Interpretation 3: General Frustration\n**Intended Meaning:** The speaker is generally frustrated with the group's inaction and uses Hillary Clinton and BLM as examples to highlight this frustration.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"you guys are very stupid\" indicates a general dissatisfaction with the group's competence.\n2. The mention of \"Hillary\" and \"BLM\" could be incidental, used as specific examples to illustrate a broader point about the group's inaction.\n3. The statement \"hillary doing everything that is against u\" could be a way to emphasize the group's failure to act in their own interests.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Provocation\n**Intended Meaning:** The speaker is intentionally provoking the group by using controversial topics like Hillary Clinton and BLM to elicit a reaction.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The direct insult \"you guys are very stupid\" is provocative.\n2. The mention of \"Hillary\" and \"BLM\" are hot-button issues that are likely to elicit strong reactions.\n3. The statement \"hillary doing everything that is against u\" could be a deliberate attempt to stir controversy and provoke a response.\n\n### Interpretation 5: Misunderstanding\n**Intended Meaning:** The speaker may be misunderstanding the group's actions or intentions and is expressing frustration based on this misunderstanding.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"you guys are very stupid\" could be a result of the speaker's frustration due to a perceived lack of action.\n2. The mention of \"Hillary\" and \"BLM\" might be based on the speaker's misinterpretation of the group's stance or actions.\n3. The statement \"hillary doing everything that is against u\" could reflect the speaker's misguided belief that the group is not acting in their best interests.\n\nEach of these interpretations provides a different lens through which to view the text, highlighting the complexity and potential for multiple meanings in implicit abusive language.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 541, "total_tokens": 1398, "completion_tokens": 857}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-acaabd12-81cd-4526-b143-436341e22c7d-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 541, "output_tokens": 857, "total_tokens": 1398}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Racial Bias', explanation=\"The text uses coded language and abstract references to express a biased view against the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.

The incomplete phrase \"but i'd be a hypocrite to sa\" implies that the speaker feels they would be hypocritical if they did not act on their beliefs.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"i do lots to attack leftists\" indicates a proactive stance against leftists.\n2. The addition of \"who espouse multi-culturalism & hate whites\" suggests that the speaker views multiculturalism as a threat to whites.\n3. The incomplete phrase \"but i'd be a hypocrite to sa\" can be interpreted as the speaker feeling they would be hypocritical if they did not take action against these perceived threats.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Self-Reflection and Internal Conflict\n**Interpretation:**\nThe speaker is reflecting on their actions and beliefs, acknowledging an internal conflict. The incomplete phrase suggests a realization that their actions might be inconsistent with their values or beliefs.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"i do lots to attack leftists\" indicates the speaker's actions.\n2. The addition of \"who espouse multi-culturalism & hate whites\" shows the speaker's perception of leftists.\n3. The incomplete phrase \"but i'd be a hypocrite to sa\" suggests the speaker is questioning their own actions and beliefs, possibly realizing that their actions might be hypocritical.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Justification of Actions\n**Interpretation:**\nThe speaker is justifying their actions against leftists and multiculturalism by framing them as a defense against perceived anti-white sentiments. The incomplete phrase suggests a reluctance to fully commit to this justification.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"i do lots to attack leftists\" indicates the speaker's actions.\n2. The addition of \"who espouse multi-culturalism & hate whites\" provides the justification for these actions.\n3. The incomplete phrase \"but i'd be a hypocrite to sa\" suggests a hesitation or reluctance to fully commit to this justification, possibly due to an awareness of the complexity of the issue.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Provocation and Attention Seeking\n**Interpretation:**\nThe speaker is intentionally provoking a reaction by making controversial statements about leftists and multiculturalism. The incomplete phrase suggests a desire to draw attention to their stance.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"i do lots to attack leftists\" is provocative and intended to draw attention.\n2. The addition of \"who espouse multi-culturalism & hate whites\" further provokes by linking multiculturalism to anti-white sentiments.\n3. The incomplete phrase \"but i'd be a hypocrite to sa\" suggests the speaker is aware of the controversial nature of their statements and is using this to draw attention.\n\n### Interpretation 5: Expression of Frustration\n**Interpretation:**\nThe speaker is expressing frustration with leftists and multiculturalism, feeling that these groups are unfairly targeting whites. The incomplete phrase suggests a sense of resignation or acceptance of their role.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"i do lots to attack leftists\" indicates the speaker's frustration.\n2.

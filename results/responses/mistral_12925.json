Here are multiple plausible interpretations of the text \"you go guys white power\" along with the reasoning paths that support each interpretation:\n\n### Interpretation 1: Call for Action\n**Interpretation:** The text is a call for action that promotes white supremacy and urges harmful actions or attitudes against non-white groups.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"white power\" is a well-known slogan associated with white supremacist ideologies.\n2. The use of \"you go guys\" in conjunction with \"white power\" suggests encouragement and support for white supremacist actions.\n3. The combination of these phrases can be interpreted as a call to action, urging individuals to engage in activities that promote white supremacy.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Other Implicit Abuse\n**Interpretation:** The text contains implicit abuse that relies on cultural and social knowledge to interpret its harmful and discriminatory message.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. \"White power\" is a racist slogan with a long history of association with white supremacist ideologies.\n2. Even if the text does not explicitly call for violence or harm, the use of this phrase implies a discriminatory message.\n3. The phrase \"you go guys\" can be seen as a form of encouragement, which, when combined with \"white power,\" suggests support for discriminatory attitudes.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Sarcastic or Ironic Use\n**Interpretation:** The text is being used sarcastically or ironically to mock or criticize white supremacist ideologies.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"you go guys\" can be interpreted as sarcastic, especially if the context suggests that the speaker is mocking the idea of white supremacy.\n2. In some social contexts, using offensive phrases ironically can be a way to criticize the ideologies they represent.\n3. The combination of \"you go guys\" and \"white power\" could be a sarcastic remark aimed at ridiculing white supremacists.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Misunderstanding or Ignorance\n**Interpretation:** The text is a result of misunderstanding or ignorance, where the speaker may not fully grasp the implications of using the phrase \"white power.\"\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The speaker might be unaware of the historical and cultural significance of the phrase \"white power.\"\n2. The phrase \"you go guys\" could be a genuine expression of encouragement, and the speaker might not realize the offensive nature of \"white power.\"\n3. The combination of these phrases could be a result of ignorance rather than a deliberate call for action or implicit abuse.\n\n### Interpretation 5: Provocation or Trolling\n**Interpretation:** The text is intended to provoke a reaction or troll individuals, particularly those who are sensitive to issues of racism and discrimination.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The use of \"white power\" is deliberately provocative, aimed at eliciting a strong reaction from the audience.\n2. The phrase \"you go guys\" could be used to add a layer of ambiguity, making it unclear whether the speaker is genuinely supportive or just trying to provoke.\n3. The combination of these phrases could be a tactic to troll or provoke individuals, especially in online or social media contexts.\n\nEach of these interpretations is supported by different reasoning paths, highlighting the complexity and potential ambiguity of the text's intended meaning.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 485, "total_tokens": 1266, "completion_tokens": 781}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-cc554fc5-9945-4ade-96fc-704a48e2f6f7-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 485, "output_tokens": 781, "total_tokens": 1266}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Interpretation 1: Call for Action, Interpretation 2: Other Implicit Abuse', explanation=\"The phrase 'white power' is a well-known slogan associated with white supremacist ideologies.

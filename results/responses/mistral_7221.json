Here are multiple plausible interpretations of the text \"soon with your vision the white will do it for you !\" along with the reasoning paths that support each interpretation:\n\n### Interpretation 1: Racial Dominance\n**Interpretation:** The text suggests that a white perspective or influence will soon dominate or overtake the recipient's vision or perspective.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"the white\" can be interpreted as a reference to white people or a white perspective.\n2. The statement \"will do it for you\" implies that this white perspective will take over or dominate.\n3. The exclamation mark adds a sense of urgency or inevitability, suggesting that this dominance is imminent.\n4. This interpretation aligns with the category of **Other Implicit Abuse**, as it requires cultural and contextual knowledge to understand the racial undertones.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Call for Harmful Action\n**Interpretation:** The text is a call for action, suggesting that \"the white\" will take some harmful or threatening action against the recipient.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"the white\" could refer to a specific group or entity.\n2. The statement \"will do it for you\" implies that this group will take action.\n3. The exclamation mark emphasizes the urgency or intensity of the action.\n4. This interpretation falls under the subtype of **Call for Action**, as it urges some form of action, potentially harmful, against the recipient.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Metaphorical Transformation\n**Interpretation:** The text metaphorically suggests that the recipient's vision or perspective will soon be transformed or improved by a white influence.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"the white\" could symbolize purity, clarity, or enlightenment.\n2. The statement \"will do it for you\" implies that this white influence will bring about a positive change.\n3. The exclamation mark adds a sense of excitement or anticipation for this transformation.\n4. This interpretation does not necessarily imply abuse but rather a positive or neutral transformation.\n\n### Interpretation 4: Coded Threat\n**Interpretation:** The text is a coded threat, suggesting that the recipient will soon face consequences or actions from \"the white.\"\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"the white\" could refer to an authoritative or powerful entity.\n2. The statement \"will do it for you\" implies that this entity will take action against the recipient.\n3. The exclamation mark adds a sense of threat or warning.\n4. This interpretation aligns with the category of **Other Implicit Abuse**, as it requires contextual knowledge to understand the coded threat.\n\n### Interpretation 5: Sarcastic Remark\n**Interpretation:** The text is a sarcastic remark, implying that the recipient's vision or perspective is flawed and will soon be corrected by a white influence.\n\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"the white\" could refer to a standard or norm that is considered superior.\n2. The statement \"will do it for you\" implies that this standard will correct or improve the recipient's vision.\n3. The exclamation mark adds a sarcastic tone, suggesting that the correction is inevitable and perhaps unwelcome.\n4. This interpretation falls under the category of **Other Implicit Abuse**, as it requires cultural knowledge to understand the sarcastic undertones.\n\nEach of these interpretations is supported by a different reasoning path, highlighting the complexity and potential ambiguity of the text.", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 533, "total_tokens": 1340, "completion_tokens": 807}, "model": "mistral-large-latest", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run-6fe87606-79ae-4a04-853e-605c6a6e831b-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 533, "output_tokens": 807, "total_tokens": 1340}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}, "hate_class": {"lc": 1, "type": "not_implemented", "id": ["__main__", "HateClassification"], "repr": "HateClassification(hate_class='implicit_hate', interpretations='Interpretation 1: Racial Dominance, Interpretation 2: Call for Harmful Action, Interpretation 4: Coded Threat, Interpretation 5: Sarcastic Remark', explanation=\"The text 'soon with your vision the white will do it for you !' can be interpreted as implicit hate speech due to its coded language and abstract references to race.

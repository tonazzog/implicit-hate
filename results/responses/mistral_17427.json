This interpretation falls under the category of **Other Implicit Abuse**, as it relies on cultural and social context to convey a derogatory message.\n\n### Interpretation 3: Humorous or Casual Remark\n**Interpretation:** The text is a casual or humorous remark not intended to be taken seriously.\n**Reasoning Path:**\n1. The phrase \"white ones\" could be a light-hearted reference to a group of people.\n2. The addition of \"i bet\" could be a playful or joking tone rather than a sarcastic one.\n3.

The phrase \"white ones\" could be a way of expressing a personal preference or opinion.\n2. The addition of \"i bet\" could be a way of emphasizing this preference or opinion.\n3.

The addition of \"i bet\" suggests a level of certainty or expectation about this prediction.\n3.
